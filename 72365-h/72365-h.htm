<i>Using This Handbook</i>
</div>


<p>This theme handbook, published in this new edition
on the 50th anniversary of Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, tells the story of the people who settled
and lived in the mountains along the Tennessee
and North Carolina border. Part 1 gives a brief introduction
to the park and its historical sites. In Part 2,
Wilma Dykeman and Jim Stokely present the history
of the region from the early Cherokee days to the
establishment of the park in 1934 and the renewed
interest in the past in the 1970s; this text was first
published by the National Park Service in 1978. Part 3
gives a brief description of the major historical buildings
you can see in the park. For general information
about the park and its wildlife, see Handbook 112.</p>


<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions to
the great natural and historic places administered
by the National Park Service, are published to support
the National Park Service’s management programs
at the parks and to promote understanding and enjoyment
of the parks. This is Handbook 125.</p>

<p>Seemingly endless ridges, forests, mountain streams,
waterfalls, and wildlife attract hundreds of thousands
of travelers each year to Great Smoky Mountains
National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina
border. Many are drawn by a long procession of
wildflowers and shrubs bursting into bloom in the
spring and by the colorful foliage of the hardwoods
in the fall. Thousands hike the park’s many trails,
which range from short spurs to the 110 kilometers
(70 miles) of the Appalachian Trail that runs through
the park. Also attracting wide interest are the park’s
historical sites and the lifeways of the mountain
people. They are pleasant surprises in the midst of
all of nature’s richness. They are physical ties with
our ancestors, many of whom traveled from their
homelands across the sea to build new homes in the
relatively unexplored continent of North America.</p>

<p>The National Park Service has preserved some of
the historic structures in Great Smoky Mountains
National Park so that we, and future generations,
can better understand how our forefathers lived. By
walking through and closely examining their finely
crafted—and crudely crafted—log houses, barns,
and other farm buildings we gain a new respect for
their diligence and perseverance. The hours spent
hewing massive beams, preserving foods for winter
use, and making clothes from scratch are nearly
incomprehensible in our age of machines and
computers. The mountainous terrain demanded hard
work, and the isolation fostered a zealous independence.
The land truly molded a resourcefulness and
hardiness in the Smokies character.</p>

<p>The story of these mountain people and communities
is told in Part 2 of this handbook by Wilma
Dykeman and Jim Stokely, who can look out on the
expanse of the Great Smokies from their family
home in Newport, Tennessee. Their engaging story
of the Smokies is illustrated with historic photographs
that largely come from the park’s files. Although the
identities of many of the photographers are unknown
(see page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>), we are no less indebted to them.
They have helped to preserve the history and
folkways of the Great Smokies people, who played a
part in molding and defining our national character.</p>

</div>


<p>It is summer now, a time for coming home. And on
an August Sunday in the mountain-green valley they
call Cataloochee, the kinfolk arrive. They come from
50 states to gather here, at a one-room white frame
Methodist church by the banks of the Big “Catalooch.”
The appearance of their shiny cars and bulky
campers rolling along the paved Park Service road
suggests that they are tourists, too, a tiny part of the
millions who visit and enjoy the Great Smoky Mountains
each year. Yet these particular families represent
something more. A few of them were raised
here; their ancestors lived and died here.</p>

<p>They are celebrating their annual Cataloochee
homecoming. Other reunions, held on Sundays
throughout the summer, bring together one-time residents
of almost every area in the park. Some of the
places instantly recall bits of history: Greenbrier,
once a heavily populated cove and political nerve-center;
Elkmont, where a blacksmith named Huskey
set out one winter to cross the Smokies and was
discovered dead in a bear trap the next spring; and
Smokemont on the beautiful Oconaluftee River, at
one time the home of the Middle Cherokee and the
very heart of that Indian Nation.</p>

<p>These are special days, but they observe a universal
experience as old as Homer’s Ulysses, as new as
the astronauts’ return from the moon: homecoming.
It is an experience particularly significant in the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park. Here, at different
times and in different ways, people of various races
and heritage have reluctantly given up hearth and
farm so that today new generations can come to this
green kingdom of some 209,000 hectares (517,000
acres) and rediscover a natural homeland which is
the heritage of all.</p>

<p>Beginning on Canada’s Gaspé Peninsula as a limestone
finger only 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) wide, the
Appalachian mountain system that dominates eastern
America slants about 5,000 kilometers (3,000
miles) southwest across New England and the Atlantic
and border states into northern Georgia and
Alabama, culminating in the grandeur and complexity
of the Great Smoky Mountains. This range, which
marks the dividing line between Tennessee and North
Carolina, is high; its 58-kilometer (36-mile) crest remains
more than 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) above sea
level. It is ancient—the Ocoee rocks here are estimated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to be 500-600 million years old—and its tall
peaks and plunging valleys have been sculpted by
nature through the action of ice and water during
long, patient centuries. The odd and fantastic courses
of the rivers here indicate that they are older than
the mountains. The Great Smokies are a land of
moving waters; there is no natural lake or pond in
this area, but there are some 1,000 kilometers (620
miles) of streams with more than 70 species of fish. A
generous rainfall, averaging as much as 229 centimeters
(90 inches) per year in some localities and
211 centimeters (83 inches) atop Clingmans Dome,
nourishes a rich variety of plantlife: more than 100
species of trees, 1,200 other flowering plants, 50
types of fern, 500 mosses and lichens, and 2,000
fungi. The mixed hardwood forest and virgin stands
of balsam and spruce are the special glories of the
Smokies.</p>

<p>Many of the species of birds that make the
Smokies their home do not have to leave to migrate;
by migrating vertically, from the valleys to the mountaintops
in summer and back down in winter, they
can experience the equivalent of a journey at sea
level from Georgia to New England. Animals large
and small find this a congenial home, and two, the
wild boar and the black bear, are especially interesting
to visitors. The former shuns people, but the
latter is occasionally seen along trails and roadsides
throughout the Smokies.</p>

<p>When the Great Smoky Mountains were added to
the National Park System in 1934, a unique mission
was accomplished: more than 6,600 separate tracts
of land had been purchased by the citizens of
Tennessee and North Carolina and given to the people
of the United States. Previously, most national
parks had been created from lands held by the Federal
Government. The story of the Great Smokies is,
therefore, most especially and significantly, a story
of people and their home. Part of that story is captured
in microcosm on an August Sunday in a secluded
northeastern corner of the park: Cataloochee.</p>

<p>History is what the homecoming is about. The
people of Cataloochee worship and sing and eat and
celebrate because they are back. And being back,
they remember. They walk up the narrow creeks,
banked by thick tangles of rhododendron and dog-hobble,
to the sites of old homesteads. They watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
their small children and grandchildren wade the water
and trample the grass of once-familiar fields.
They call themselves Caldwell, Palmer, Hannah,
Woody, Bennett, Messer. For exactly a century—from
the late 1830s and the coming of the first permanent
white settlers to the later 1930s and the coming
of the park—men and women with these names lived
along Cataloochee Creek. But these pioneers were
not the first to inhabit a valley that they called by an
Indian name.</p>

<p>By “Gad-a-lu-tsi,” the Cherokees meant “standing
up in ranks.” As they looked from Cove Creek Gap
at the eastern end of the valley across toward the
Balsam Mountains, they used that term to describe
the thin stand of timber at the top of the distant
range. Later, the name became “Cataloochee,” or
the colloquial “Catalooch,” and it referred to the
entire watershed of the central stream.</p>

<p>The Cherokees liked what they saw. They hunted
and fished throughout the area and established small
villages along one of their main trails. The Cataloochee
Track, as it came to be known, ran from
Cove Creek Gap at the eastern edge of the present-day
park up over the Smokies and down through
what is now the Cosby section of eastern Tennessee.
It connected large Indian settlements along the upper
French Broad River in North Carolina with the
equally important Overhill Towns of the Tennessee
River.</p>

<p>By the early 1700s, Cataloochee formed a minor
portion of the great Cherokee Nation whose towns
and villages extended from eastern Tennessee and
western North Carolina into northern Georgia. But
as time went on, and as the white settlements pushed
westward from the wide eastern front, the Cherokees
lost dominion over this vast area. In 1791, at the
treaty of Holston, the Cherokees gave up Cataloochee
along with much of what is now East Tennessee. Five
years later the state of North Carolina granted 71,210
hectares (176,000 acres), including all of Cataloochee,
to John Gray Blount—brother to William Blount,
governor of the Territory South of the Ohio River, as
Tennessee was then called. Blount kept the land for
speculation, but it eventually sold for less than one
cent per hectare. Now that the Cherokees had
relinquished the land, no one else seemed to want it.
Even the famous Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
first sent as a missionary to America in 1771, apparently
wavered in his spirit when confronted with the
Cataloochee wilderness. In his journal in 1810 he
lamented:</p>

<p>“<i>At Catahouche I walked over a log. But O the
mountain height after height, and five miles over!
After crossing other streams, and losing ourselves in
the woods, we came in, about nine o’clock at night....
What an awful day!</i>”</p>

<p>During the 1820s, only a few hunters, trappers,
and fishermen built overnight cabins in the area.
Then in 1834, Col. Robert Love, who had migrated
from Virginia, fought in the Revolutionary War, and
established a farm near the present city of Asheville,
purchased the original Blount tract for $3,000. To
keep title to the land, Love was required to maintain
permanent settlers there. He encouraged cattle ranging
and permitted settlers choice locations and unlimited
terms, and by the late 1830s several families
had moved into Cataloochee. Probably the first settler
to put down roots was young Levi Caldwell, a
householder in his early twenties seeking a good
home for his new family. The rich bottomlands and
abundant forests of Cataloochee offered that home,
and before Levi Caldwell died in 1864 at the age of
49, he and his wife “Polly” (Mary Nailling) had 11
children. Levi was a prisoner during the Civil War,
and two of his sons, Andrew and William Harrison,
fought on different sides. Because he had tended
horses for the widely feared band of Union soldiers
called Kirk’s Army, Andy received a $12 pension
when the war was over. William, who might have
forgiven and forgotten his differences with the Union
as a whole, was never quite reconciled to his
brother’s pension.</p>

<p>Although he was older than Levi Caldwell by a full
21 years, George Palmer arrived later at Catalooch.
The Palmers had settled further northeast in the
North Carolina mountains, on Sandy Mush Creek,
and seemed content there. But when George decided
to start over, he and his wife, also named
Polly, took their youngest children, Jesse and George
Lafayette, and crossed the mountains south into
Cataloochee. They began again.</p>

<p><i>Cataloochee and Caldwell—the
names are nearly synonymous.

family once lived in this sturdy
log house with shake roof and

Fork. At another time, this

predominant
families.</i></p>

<p>Other families trickled in. As elsewhere in Southern
Appalachia, buffalo traces and old Indian trails
and more recent traders’ paths gradually became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
roads and highways penetrating the thick forests and
mountain fastnesses. In 1846, the North Carolina
legislature passed an act creating the Jonathan Creek
and Tennessee Mountain Turnpike Company, which
was to build a road no less than 3.7 meters (12 feet)
wide and no steeper than a 12 percent grade. Tolls
would range from 75 cents for a six-horse wagon
down to a dime for a man or a horse and one cent for
each hog or sheep. After a full five years of deliberation
and examining alternatives, the company selected
a final route and constructed the highway
with minor difficulty. The road fully utilized the
natural contours of the land and was at the same
time a generally direct line. It followed almost exactly
the old Cherokee Trail.</p>



<p>The Cataloochee Turnpike was the first real wagon
road in the Smokies. It opened up a chink in the
area’s armor of isolation. Travel to and from the
county seat still required the better part of three
days, however. Two of the rare 19th century literary
visitors to these mountains—Wilbur Zeigler and Ben
Grosscup, whose book <i>The Heart of the Alleghanies</i>,
appeared in 1883—entered Cataloochee along this
road. Their reaction provides a pleasant contrast to
that of Bishop Asbury; they speak of the “canon of
the Cataluche” as being “the most picturesque valley
of the Great Smoky range:”</p>

<p>“<i>The mountains are timbered, but precipitous; the
narrow, level lands between are fertile; farm houses
look upon a rambling road, and a creek, noted as a
prolific trout stream, runs a devious course through
hemlock forests, around romantic cliffs, and between
laureled banks.</i>”</p>

<p>During the 1840s and 1850s, some 15 or 20 families
built their sturdy log cabins ax-hewn out of huge
chestnuts and poplars, and then built barns, smokehouses,
corncribs, and other farm shelters beside the
rocky creeks. George Palmer’s son Lafayette, called
“Fate” for short, married one of Levi Caldwell’s
daughters and established a large homestead by the
main stream. Fate’s brother, Jesse, married and had
13 children; 6 of these 13 later married Caldwells.</p>

<p>They ate well. The creek bottomlands provided
rich soil for tomatoes, corn and beans, cabbage and
onions, potatoes and pumpkins. Split rail fences were
devices to keep the cattle, hogs, and sheep out of the
crops; the animals themselves foraged freely throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the watershed, fattening on succulent grasses
and an ample mast of acorns and chestnuts. Corn
filled the cribs, salted pork and beef layered the
meathouse, and cold bountiful springs watered the
valley.</p>

<p>The Civil War erupted in 1861. Although Cataloochee
lay officially in the Confederacy, this creek
country was so remote, so distant from the slave
plantations of the deep South, that no government
dominated. Raiding parties from both sides rode
through the valley, killing and looting as they went.
Near Mt. Sterling Gap at the northern end of the
watershed, Kirk’s Army made a man named Grooms
play a fiddle before they murdered him. The people
of Catalooch kept his memory alive throughout the
century by playing that ill-starred “Grooms tune.”</p>

<p>But the war was only an interlude. Five years after
its end, Cataloochee was estimated to have 500 hogs,
sheep, milch cows, beef cattle, and horses; some 900
kilograms (2,000 pounds) of honey; and about 1,250
liters (1,320 quarts) of sorghum molasses. Sizable
apple crops would begin to flourish during the next
decade, and by 1900 the population of the valley
would grow to over 700. Producing more than they
themselves could use, these farmers began to trade
with the outside world. They took their apples,
livestock, chestnuts, eggs, honey, and ginseng to
North Carolina markets in Fines Creek, Canton, and
Waynesville, and to Tennessee outlets in Cosby,
Newport, and Knoxville. With their cash money,
they changed forever the Cataloochee of the early
1800s.</p>

<p>They sold honey and bought the tools of
education. Using the tough, straight wood of a black
gum or a basswood, a farmer hollowed out a section
of the trunk with a chisel. He then slid a cross-stick
through a hole bored near the bottom. Upon
transplanting a beehive into the trunk and leaving an
entrance at the bottom, he covered the top with a
solid wooden lid and sealed it airtight with a mixture
of mud and swamp-clay. In August, especially after
the sourwoods had bloomed and the bees had built
up a store of the delicately flavored honey, the beekeeper
took a long hooked honey knife, broke the
sealing, and cut out squares of the light golden comb
to fill ten-gallon tins. He never went below the cross-stick;
that honey was left for the bees. An enterprising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
family might trade 10 tins of honey in a season.
And at the market, they would turn that honey into
school supplies for the coming year: shoes, books,
tablets, and pencils.</p>

<p><i>Like many others in the

was a little more

scraps of tin, with the help
of a couple of rocks, sufficed,

mud.</i></p>

<p>There were too few families on Big Cataloochee
for both a Methodist and a Baptist church. In 1858
Colonel Love’s son had deeded a small tract there
for the Palmers, Bennetts, Caldwells, and Woodys to
use as a Methodist meetinghouse and school. Since
then, the Messers and Hannahs and several others
had formed a community of their own 8 kilometers
(5 miles) north, across Noland Mountain, along the
smaller valley of the Little Cataloochee. They built a
Baptist church there in 1890.</p>

<p>But the differences were not great. One of the Big
Cataloochee’s sons became and remained the high
sheriff of sprawling Haywood County with the well-nigh
solid support of the combined Cataloochee vote.
Running six times in succession and against a candidate
from the southeastern part of the county, he
was rumored to have waited each time for the more
accessible lowlands to record their early returns.
Then he simply contacted a cousin, who happened
to be the recorder for Cataloochee, who would ask
in his slow, easy voice, “How many do you need,
cousin?”</p>

<p>The preacher came once a month. He stayed with
different families in the community and met the rest
at church. More informal gatherings, such as Sunday
School and singings, took place each week. And
during late summer or fall, when crops were “laid
by” and there was an interval between spring’s cultivation
and autumn’s harvest, there came the socializing
and fervor of camp meeting. A one-week or
ten-day revival was cause for school to be let out at
11 o’clock each morning. The children were required
to attend long and fervent services. But between
exhortations there were feasts of food, frolicking in
nearby fields and streams, and for everyone an exchange
of good fellowship.</p>

<p>Besides these religious gatherings, women held
bean-stringings and quilting bees, men assembled for
logrollings or house-raisings to clear new lands and
build new homes. One of the few governmental intrusions
into Cataloochee life was the road requirement.
During the spring and fall, all able-bodied men were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>“warned out” for six days—eight if there had been
washout rains—to keep up what had become the
well-used Cataloochee Turnpike. If a man brought a
mule and a bull-tongue plow instead of the usual
mattock, he received double time for ditching the
sides of the road. This heavy work gave the men
both a chance to talk and something to talk about.
But any of them would still have said that the hardest
job of the year was hoeing corn all day on a lonely,
stony hillside.</p>

<p>By the early 1900s, Cataloochee had become a
mixture of isolation from the outside world and communication
with it. Outside laws had affected the
valley; in 1885 North Carolina passed the controversial
No Fence law, which made fences within townships
unnecessary and required owners to keep
cattle, sheep, horses, and hogs inside certain bounds.
But other laws were less heeded; local experts have
estimated that 95 percent of Cataloochee residents
made their own whisky. Several families subscribed
to a newspaper—“Uncle Jim” Woody took <i>The
Atlanta Constitution</i>—and almost everyone possessed
the “wish-book:” a dog-eared mail order
catalog. But no one in Little Cataloochee bought an
automobile.</p>

<p>The valley thrived on local incidents. A man shot
a deputy sheriff and hid out near a large rock above
Fate Palmer’s homestead; Neddy McFalls and Dick
Clark fed him there for years. Will Messer, a master
carpenter and coffinmaker over on Little Catalooch,
had a daughter named Ola. Messer was postmaster,
and the post office acquired her name. Fate Palmer’s
shy son, Robert, became known as the “Booger Man”
after he hid his face in his arms and gave that as his
name to a new teacher on the first day of school.</p>

<p>George Palmer, son of Jesse and brother to Sheriff
William, devised a method of capturing wild turkeys.
He first built a log enclosure, then dug a trench
under one side and baited it with corn. The next
morning 10 turkeys, too frightened to retrace their
steps through the trench, showed up inside the
enclosure. But when George stepped among them
and attempted to catch them, the turkeys gave him
the beating of his life. Thereafter he was called
“Turkey George.” And his daughter, Nellie, lent her
name to one of the two post offices on Big Catalooch.</p>

<p>Yet the simplicity of life could not insulate the
Cataloochee area from “progress.” As the 20th century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
unfolded, scattered individual loggers gave way
to the well organized methods of large company
operations. Small-scale cutting of yellow-tulip poplar
and cherry boomed into big business during the early
1900s. Suncrest Lumber Company, with a sawmill in
Waynesville, began operations on Cataloochee Creek
and hauled out hardwood logs in great quantities.
Although the spruce and balsam at the head of the
watershed were left standing, the logging industry,
with its capital, manpower, and influence, vastly altered
the valley.</p>

<p>With the late 1920s came an announcement that
the states of North Carolina and Tennessee had decided
to give the Great Smoky Mountains to the
nation as a park. The residents of Cataloochee were
incredulous. They were attached to this homeplace;
they still referred to a short wagon ride as a trip and
called a visit to the county seat a journey. But the
park arrived, and the young families of the valley
moved away, and then the older ones did the same.
Gradually they came to understand that another sort
of homeland had been established. And the strangers
who now visit their valleys and creeks can look
about and appreciate the heritage these settlers and
their descendants left behind.</p>

<p>The old families still come back. They return to
this creek on the August Sunday of Homecoming. In
the early morning hours they fill the wooden benches
of tiny Palmer’s Chapel for singing and preaching
and reminiscing; at noon they share bountiful food
spread on long plank tables beside clear, rushing
Cataloochee Creek; in the mellow afternoon they
rediscover the valley. For what lures the stranger is
what lures the old families back. They come to sense
again the beauty and the permanence and even the
foggy mystery of the Great Smokies. And this that
beckons them back is that which beckoned the Indian
discoverers of these mountains hundreds of
years ago.</p>

<p>“Something there is that does
not love a wall,” poet Robert
Frost once wrote. Likewise,
many mountain people felt
something there is that does
not love a fence. Fences
were built for the purpose of
keeping certain creatures out—and
keeping other creatures
in. During early days of
settlement there were no
stock-laws in the mountains.
Cattle, mules, horses, hogs,
sheep, and fowls ranged freely
over the countryside. Each
farmer had to build fences to
protect his garden and crops
from these domestic foragers
as well as some of the wild
“varmint” marauders. Rail
fences had several distinct
merits: they provided a practical
use for some of the trees
felled to clear crop and pasture
land; they required little
repair; they blended esthetically
into the surroundings
and landscape. Mountain
fences have been described
as “horse-high, bull-strong,
and pig-tight.” W. Clark
Medford, of North Carolina,
has told us how worm fences
(<a href="#i030_1">right</a>) were built:</p>

</figure>

<p>“There was no way to build a
fence in those days except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
with rails—just like there was
no way to cover a house except
with boards. First, they
went into the woods, cut a
good ‘rail tree’ and, with axes,
wedge and gluts, split the cuts
(of six-, eight- and ten-foot
lengths as desired) into the
rail. After being hauled to
location, they were placed
along the fence-way, which
had already been cut out and
made ready. Next, the ‘worm’
was laid. That is, the ground-rails
were put down, end-on-end,
alternating the lengths—first
a long rail, then a short
one—and so on through. Anyone
who has seen a rail fence
knows that the rails were laid
end-on-end at angles—not at
right angles, but nearly so.
One course of rails after another
would be laid up on the
fence until it had reached the
desired height (most fences
were about eight rails high,
some ten). Then, at intervals,
the corners (where the rails
lapped) would be propped
with poles, and sometimes a
stake would be driven. Such
fences, when built of good
chestnut or chestnut-oak rails,
lasted for many years if kept
from falling down.”</p>

<p>One of the most valuable
fences ever constructed in the
Smoky Mountains was surely
that of Abraham Mingus.
When “Uncle Abe,” one-time
postmaster and miller,
needed rails for fencing, he
“cut into a field thick with
walnut timber, split the tree
bodies, and fenced his land
with black walnut rails.”</p>

<p>The variety of fences was
nearly infinite. Sherman
Myers leans against a sturdy
post and rider (<a href="#i030_2">below</a>) near
Primitive Baptist Church.
Other kinds of fences are
shown on the next two pages.</p>

<p>The Cherokees were among the first. They were
the first to inhabit the Smokies, the first to leave
them and yet remain behind. By the 1600s these
Indians had built in the Southern Appalachians a
Nation hundreds of years old, a way of life in harmony
with the surrounding natural world, a culture
richly varied and satisfying. But barely two centuries
later, the newly formed government of the United
States was pushing the Cherokees ever farther west.
In the struggle for homeland, a new era had arrived:
a time for the pioneer and for the settler from Europe
and the eastern seaboard to stake claims to what
seemed to them mere wilderness but which to the
Cherokees was a physical and spiritual abode.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was during the last Ice Age that Indians
drifted from Asia to this continent across what was
then a land passage through Alaska’s Bering Strait.
Finding and settling various regions of North
America, this ancient people fragmented after thousands
of years into different tribal and linguistic
stocks. The Iroquois, inhabitants of what are now
the North Central and Atlantic states, became one of
the most distinctive of these stocks.</p>

<p>By the year 1000, the Cherokees, a tribe of
Iroquoian origin, had broken off the main line and
turned south. Whether wanting to or being pressured
to, they slowly followed the mountain leads of
the Blue Ridge and the Alleghenies until they
reached the security and peace of the mist-shrouded
Southern Appalachians. These “Mountaineers,” as
other Iroquois called them, claimed an empire of
roughly 104,000 square kilometers (40,000 square
miles). Bounded on the north by the mighty Ohio
River, it stretched southward in a great circle through
eight states, including half of South Carolina and
almost all of Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Cherokee settlements dotted much of this territory,
particularly in eastern Tennessee, western
North Carolina, and northern Georgia. These state
regions are the rough outlines of what came to be
the three main divisions of the Cherokee Nation: the
Lower settlements on the headwaters of the Savannah
River in Georgia and South Carolina; the Middle
Towns on the Little Tennessee and Tuckasegee
rivers in North Carolina; and the Overhill Towns
with a capital on the Tellico River in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Between the Middle and the Overhill Cherokee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
straddling what is now the North Carolina-Tennessee
line, lay the imposing range of the Great Smoky
Mountains. Except for Mt. Mitchell in the nearby
Blue Ridge, these were the highest mountains east of
the Black Hills in South Dakota and the Rockies in
Colorado. They formed the heart of the territorial
Cherokee Nation. The Oconaluftee River, rushing
down to the Tuckasegee from the North Carolina
side of the Smokies, watered the homesites and fields
of many Cherokees. Kituwah, a Middle Town near
the present-day Deep Creek campground, may have
been in the first Cherokee village.</p>

<p><i>Adventurers were drawn to
the Great Smoky Mountains
and the surrounding area in
the 18th century. In 1760 a
young British agent from
Virginia, Lt. Henry Timberlake,
journeyed far into
Cherokee country. He observed
Indian life and even
sketched a map of the Overhill
territory, complete with
Fort Loudoun, “Chote” or
Echota, and the “Enemy
Mountains.”</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>For the most part, however, the Cherokees settled
only in the foothills of the Smokies. Like the later
pioneers, the Cherokees were content with the fertile
lands along the rivers and creeks. But more than
contentment was involved. Awed by this tangled
wilderness, the Indians looked upon these heights as
something both sacred and dangerous. One of the
strongest of the old Cherokee myths tells of a race of
spirits living there in mountain caves. These handsome
“Little People” were usually helpful and kind,
but they could make the intruder lose his way.</p>

<p>If the Cherokees looked up to the Smokies, they
aimed at life around them with a level eye. Although
the Spanish explorer Hernando DeSoto and his soldiers
ventured through Cherokee country in 1540
and chronicled generally primitive conditions, a
Spanish missionary noted 17 years later that the
Cherokees appeared “sedate and thoughtful, dwelling
in peace in their native mountains; they cultivated
their fields and lived in prosperity and plenty.”</p>

<p>They were moderately tall and rather slender with
long black hair and sometimes very light complexions.
They wore animal skin loincloths and robes, moccasins
and a knee-length buckskin hunting shirt. A
Cherokee man might dress more gaudily than a
woman, but both enjoyed decorating their bodies
extravagantly, covering themselves with paint and,
as trade with whites grew and flourished, jewelry.</p>

<p>The tepee of Indian lore did not exist here. The
Cherokee house was a rough log structure with one
door and no windows. A small hole in the bark roof
allowed smoke from a central fire to escape. Furniture
and decorations included cane seats and painted
hemp rugs. A good-sized village might number 40 or
50 houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Chota, in the Overhill country on the Little
Tennessee River, was a center of civil and religious
authority; it was also known as a “Town of Refuge,”
a place of asylum for Indian criminals, especially
murderers. The Smokies settlement of Kituwah
served as a “Mother Town,” or a headquarters, for
one of the seven Cherokee clans.</p>

<p>These clans—Wolf, Blue, Paint, Bird, Deer, Long
Hair, and Wild Potato—were basic to the social
structure of the tribe. The Cherokees traced their
kinship by clan; marriage within clans was forbidden.
And whereas the broad divisions of Lower, Middle,
and Overhill followed natural differences in geography
and dialect, the clans assumed great political
significance. Each clan selected its own chiefs and
its own “Mother Town.” Although one or two persons
in Chota might be considered symbolic leaders, any
chief’s powers were limited to advice and persuasion.</p>

<p>The Cherokees extended this democratic tone to
all their towns. Each village, whether built along or
near a stream or surrounded by protective log
palisades, would have as its center a Town House
and Square. The Square, a level field in front, was
used for celebrations and dancing. The Town House
itself sheltered the town council, plus the entire
village, during their frequent meetings. In times of
decision-making, as many as 500 people crowded
into the smoky, earth-domed building where they sat
in elevated rows around the council and heard debates
on issues from war to the public granary.</p>

<p>Democracy was the keynote of the Cherokee
Nation. “White” chiefs served during peacetime;
“Red” chiefs served in time of war. Priests once
formed a special class, but after an episode in which
one of the priests attempted to “take” the wife of the
leading chief’s brother, all such privileged persons
were made to take their place alongside—not in
front of—the other members of the community.</p>

<p>Women enjoyed the same status in Cherokee society
as men. Clan kinship, land included, followed the
mother’s side of the family. Although the men hunted
much of the time, they helped with some household
duties, such as sewing. Marriages were solemnly
negotiated. And it was possible for women to sit in
the councils as equals to men. Indeed, Nancy Ward,
one of those equals who enjoyed the rank of Beloved
Woman, did much to strengthen bonds of friendship
between Cherokee and white during the turbulent
years of the mid-18th century. The Irishman James
Adair, who traded with the Cherokees during the
years 1736 to 1743, even accused these Indians of
“petticoat government.” Yet he must have found
certain attractions in this arrangement, for he himself
married a Cherokee woman of the Deer Clan.</p>

<p>Adair, an intent observer of Indian life, marveled
at the Cherokees’ knowledge of nature’s medicines:
“<i>I do not remember to have seen or heard of an
Indian dying by the bite of a snake, when out at war,
or a hunting ... they, as well as all other Indian
nations, have a great knowledge of specific virtues in
simples: applying herbs and plants, on the most dangerous
occasions, and seldom if ever, fail to effect a
thorough cure, from the natural bush.... For my
own part, I would prefer an old Indian before any
surgeon whatsoever.</i>...”</p>

<p>The Indians marveled at nature itself. A Civil War
veteran remarked that the Cherokees “possess a keen
and delicate appreciation of the beautiful in nature.”
Most of their elaborate mythology bore a direct
relation to rock and plant, animal and tree, river and
sky. One myth told of a tortoise and a hare. The
tortoise won the race, but not by steady plodding.
He placed his relatives at intervals along the course;
the hare, thinking the tortoise was outrunning him at
every turn, wore himself out before the finish.</p>

<p>The Cherokees’ many myths and their obedience
to nature required frequent performance of rituals.
There were many nature celebrations, including
three each corn season: the first at the planting of
this staple crop, the second at the very beginning of
the harvest, the third and last and largest at the
moment of the fullest ripening. One of the most
important rites, the changing of the fire, inaugurated
each new year. All flames were extinguished and the
hearths were swept clean of ashes. The sacred fire at
the center of the Town House was then rekindled.</p>

<p>One ritual aroused particular enthusiasm: war. Battles
drew the tribe together, providing an arena for
fresh exploits and a common purpose and source of
inspiration for the children. The Cherokees, with
their spears, bows and arrows, and mallet-shaped
clubs, met any challenger: Shawnee, Tuscarora,
Creek, English, or American. In 1730, Cherokee
chiefs told English emissaries: “Should we make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
peace with the Tuscaroras ... we must immediately
look for some other with whom we can be engaged
in our beloved occupation.” Even in peacetime, the
Cherokees might invade settlements just for practice.</p>

<p>But when the white man came, the struggle was
for larger stakes. In 1775 William Bartram, the first
able native-born American botanist, could explore
the dangerous Cherokee country and find artistry
there, perfected even in the minor arts of weaving
and of carving stone tobacco pipes. He could meet
and exchange respects with the famous Cherokee
statesman Attakullakulla, also known as the Little
Carpenter. And yet, a year later, other white men
would destroy more than two-thirds of the settled
Cherokee Nation.</p>

<p>Who were these fateful newcomers? Most of them
were Scotch-Irish, a distinctive and adventuresome
blend of people transplanted chiefly from the
Scottish Lowlands to Northern Ireland during the
reign of James I. Subsequently they flocked to the
American frontier in search of religious freedom,
economic opportunity, and new land they could call
their own.</p>

<p>In the late 1600s, while the English colonized the
Atlantic seaboard in North and South Carolina and
Virginia, while the French settled Alabama, Mississippi,
and Louisiana ports on the Gulf of Mexico,
and while the Spanish pushed into Florida, 5,000
Presbyterian Scots left England for “the Plantation”
in Northern Ireland. But as they settled and
prospered, England passed laws prohibiting certain
articles of Irish trade, excluding Presbyterians from
civil and military offices, even declaring their ministers
liable to prosecution for performing marriages.</p>

<p>The Scotch-Irish, as they were then called, found
such repression unbearable and fled in the early 18th
century to ports in Delaware and Pennsylvania. With
their influx, Pennsylvania land prices skyrocketed.
Poor, rocky soil to the immediate west turned great
numbers of these Scotch-Irish southward down
Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley and along North
Carolina’s Piedmont plateau. From 1732 to 1754, the
population of North Carolina more than doubled.
Extravagant stories of this new and fertile land also
drew many from the German Palatinate to America;
during the middle 1700s these hardworking “Pennsylvania
Dutch” poured into the southern colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia were colonies
of the crown, and the Scotch-Irish and Germans
intermarried with the already settled British. These
Englishmen, of course, had their own reasons for
leaving their more conservative countrymen in the
mother country and starting a whole new life. Some
were adventurers eager to explore a different land,
some sought religious freedom, not a few were second
sons—victims of the law of primogeniture—who
arrived with hopes of building new financial empires
of their own. They all confronted the frontier.</p>

<p>They encountered the Cherokee Nation and its
vast territory. Earliest relations between the Cherokees
and the pioneers were, to say the least, marked
by paradox. Traders like James Adair formed economic
ties and carried on a heavy commerce of guns
for furs, whisky for blankets, jewelry for horses. But
there was also deep resentment. The English
colonies, especially South Carolina, even took Indian
prisoners and sold them into slavery.</p>

<p>The Spanish had practiced this kind of slavery,
arguing that thus the Indians would be exposed to
the boon of Christianity. The English colonies employed
what were known as “indentured servants,”
persons who paid off the cost of their passage to
America by working often as hard as slaves. And in
later years both the white man and some of the more
prosperous Cherokees kept Negro slaves. Such instances
in the Nation were more rare than not,
however, and a Cherokee might work side by side
with any slave he owned; marriage between them
was not infrequent. Be that as it may, the deplorable
colonial policy of enforced servitude at any level,
which continued into the late 1700s, sowed seeds of
bitterness that ended in a bloody harvest.</p>

<p>Like the pioneers, the Cherokees cherished liberty
above all else and distrusted government. Both left
religion to the family and refused to institute any
orthodox system of belief. Even the forms of humor
were often parallel; the Cherokee could be as sarcastic
as the pioneer and used irony to correct behavior.
As one historian put it: “The coward was praised for
his valor; the liar for his veracity; and the thief for
his honesty.” But through the ironies of history, the
Scotch-Irish-English-German pioneers of the highlands,
who were similar to the Cherokees in a multitude
of ways and quite different from the lowland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
aristocrats, became the Indians’ worst enemy.</p>

<p>Their conflict was, in a sense, inevitable. The
countries of England and France and their representatives
in America both battled and befriended the
Cherokees during the 18th century. Their main concern
lay in their own rivalry, not in any deep-founded
argument with the Indians. As they expanded the
American frontier and immersed themselves in the
process of building a country, the colonists inevitably
encroached upon the Cherokee Nation.</p>

<p>In 1730, in a burst of freewheeling diplomacy, the
British sent a flamboyant and remarkable representative,
Sir Alexander Cuming, into remote Cherokee
country on a mission of goodwill. After meeting with
the Indians on their own terms and terrain, Cuming
arranged a massive public relations campaign and
escorted Attakullakulla and six other Cherokee leaders
to London, where they were showered with gifts
and presented at court to King George II. The Cherokees
allied themselves with Britain, but this did not
discourage the French from trying to win their
allegiance. When the English in 1743 captured a
persuasive visionary named Christian Priber who
sought to transform the Cherokee Nation into a socialist
utopia, they suspected him of being a French
agent and took him to prison in Frederica, Georgia.
He was left to die in the fort.</p>

<p>The British soldiers were not as friendly as British
diplomats. During the French and Indian War of the
late 1750s and the early 1760s, when England battled
France for supremacy in the New World, English
soldiers treated the Cherokees with disdain and
violence. The Cherokees returned the atrocities in
kind. The frontier blazed with death and destruction;
each side accumulated its own collection of horrors
endured and meted out. Although Cherokee chiefs
sued for peace, Gov. William Henry Lyttleton of
South Carolina declared war on them in 1759. The
Carolinas offered 25 English pounds for every Indian
scalp. A year later the Cherokees, under the command
of Oconostota, captured Fort Loudoun at the
fork of the Tellico and Little Tennessee rivers. But in
June of 1761, Capt. James Grant and some 2,600
men destroyed the Nation’s Middle Towns, burning
600 hectares (1,500 acres) of corn, beans, and peas,
and forcing 5,000 Cherokees into the forests for the
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>After the English defeated the French in 1763, the
British government moved to appease the Indians
and consolidate its control of the continent. A British
proclamation forbade all white settlement beyond
the Appalachian divide. But the proclamation was
soon to be broken. Pioneers such as Daniel Boone
and James Robertson successfully led their own and
neighbors’ families through Appalachian gaps and
river valleys until a trickle of explorers became a
flood of homesteaders. During the next decade, settlers
poured across the mountains into Kentucky
and northeastern Tennessee.</p>

<p>While England was regaining the friendship of the
Cherokees, the American colonists were alienating
both the Indians and the British. In the late 1760s a
group of North Carolinians calling themselves Regulators
opposed taxation, land rents, and extensive
land grants to selected individuals, and caused unrest
throughout the Piedmont. In 1771, at Alamance,
an estimated 2,000 Regulators were defeated by the
troops of British Gov. William Tryon. Thousands of
anti-royalist North Carolinians fled westward as a
result of this battle. Alexander Cameron, an English
representative living in the Overhill Towns, wrote in
1766 that the pioneer occupation of Cherokee lands
amounted to an infestation by villains and horse
thieves that was “enough to create disturbances
among the most Civilized Nations.”</p>

<p>The protest spirit of the Regulators spread to the
New England colonies during the early 1770s. By
1776, when the American Revolution began, the
Cherokees had understandably but unfortunately
chosen to take the British side. Britain issued guns to
all Indians and offered rewards for American scalps,
yet this was not enough to secure the over-mountain
territory for the English crown. Within a year, American
forces were fighting for the frontier, and in a
coordinated pincer movement, Col. Samuel Jack
with 200 Georgians, Gen. Griffith Rutherford with
2,400 North Carolinians, Col. Andrew Williamson
with 1,800 South Carolinians, and Col. William Christian
with 2,000 Virginians demolished more than 50
Cherokee towns. Two treaties resulted from this
campaign; more than 2 million hectares (5 million
acres) of Indian land, including northeastern Tennessee,
much of South Carolina, and all lands east of
the Blue Ridge, were ceded to the United States.</p>

<p>Peace did not follow the treaties, however. Dragging
Canoe, pock-marked son of Attakullakulla, decided
to fight. Against the wishes of many Cherokee
chiefs, he organized a renegade tribe that moved to
five Lower Towns near present-day Chattanooga
where they became known as the Chickamaugas.
But the eventual outcome of the drama had already
been determined. Despite conflict and danger, the
settlers pushed on. In 1780 the Tennesseans John
Sevier and Isaac Shelby joined forces with those of
William Campbell from Virginia and Joseph McDowell
from North Carolina and managed to win a decisive
victory over the English at Kings Mountain, South
Carolina. By fighting Indian-style on rugged hillside
terrain, they overwhelmed a detachment of General
Cornwallis’ southern forces under Col. Patrick
Ferguson. These over-mountain men immediately
returned to Tennessee and in reprisal for Indian
raids during their absence destroyed Chota and nine
other Overhill Towns, slaughtering women and children
as well as Cherokee warriors.</p>

<p>In 1783, with the end of the Revolution, all hope
for the survival of the original Cherokee Nation was
extinguished. Although the newly formed American
government attempted to conciliate the Indians, it
could not prevent its own citizens from hungering
for ever larger bites of land. Treaties with the loose
Cherokee confederation of clans became more and
more frequent. As if by fate, a disastrous smallpox
epidemic struck the Cherokees; the number of warriors
dwindled to less than half of what it had been 50
years before. The Cherokee capital was moved from
Chota southward into Georgia. In 1794 Maj. James
Ore and 550 militiamen from Nashville, Tennessee,
obliterated the Chickamaugas and their Five Towns.</p>

<p>Most of the Cherokees parted with the Smokies.
At the Treaty of Holston in 1791, they gave up the
northeastern quarter of what is now the park. Seven
years later, they ceded a southern strip. And at
Washington, D.C., in February of 1819, nearly a
century after their first treaty with the white man in
1721, the Cherokees signed their 21st treaty. This
time they parted with a quarter of their entire Nation,
and they lost the rest of their sacred Smoky
Mountains. Scattered families continued to live in
the foothills. But the newcomer—this pioneer turned
settler—had arrived.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Pioneers_Arrive">The Pioneers Arrive</h2>
</div>


<p>Into the Smokies they came, but the coming was
slow. The early pioneers of the Old Southwest had
conquered the lowlands of North Carolina and
Tennessee with relative ease. The higher country of
the Great Smoky Mountains, set into the Southern
Appalachians like a great boulder among scattered
stones, would yield less quickly.</p>

<p>The pioneers began, as the Cherokees had done,
with the most accessible land. The level Oconaluftee
valley, stretching its timbered swath from present-day
Cherokee, North Carolina, on up into the forks
and tributaries of the Great Smokies, beckoned with
at least some possibilities to the hopeful settler. As
early as 1790, Dr. Joseph Dobson, a North Carolina
Revolutionary War veteran who had accompanied
Rutherford on his 1777 campaign against the
Cherokees, entered into deed a tract on the
Oconaluftee. But the claim was void; the valley still
belonged to the Indians.</p>

<p>John Walker had also ridden with Rutherford. His
son Felix, a student and friend of Dr. Dobson, lawfully
received in 1795 a sizable land grant to the
valley. Young Walker was more than willing to let
settlers attempt development of this wild area. Two
North Carolina families decided to try. John Jacob
Mingus and Ralph Hughes took their wives and children
and journeyed into the “Lufty” regions of the
Smokies. They cleared small homesteads by the
river; they were all alone.</p>

<p>In 1803, Abraham Enloe and his family moved up
from South Carolina and joined the growing families
of Mingus and Hughes. Enloe chose land directly
across the river from John Mingus, and by 1820
Abraham’s daughter Polly had married John, junior.
“Dr. John,” as the younger Mingus was respectfully
called in his later years, learned much about medicine
from the scattered Cherokees remaining in the
area.</p>

<p>Other families, Carolinian and Georgian and
Virginian alike, arrived and stayed. Collins, Bradley,
Beck, Conner, Floyd, Sherrill: these and others settled
beside the river itself, and their children moved
along the creeks and branches. Fresh lands were
cleared, new homes built; the Oconaluftee was being
transformed. And further to the southwest, Forney
Creek was being claimed by Crisps and Monteiths,

colonized by Abraham Wiggins and his descendants.</p>

<p>The Tennessee side of the Smokies, furrowed by
its own series of rivers and creeks, awaited
settlement. By 1800 a few Virginians and Carolinians
were drifting into the four-year-old state of Tennessee,
willing to settle.</p>

<p>The first family of Gatlinburg was probably a
mother and her seven children. This widow, Martha
Huskey Ogle, brought five sons and two daughters
from Edgefield, South Carolina. Richard Reagan, a
Scotch-Irishman from Virginia, and his family joined
the Ogles and began to clear land. His son, Daniel
Wesley Reagan, born in 1802, was the first child of
the settlement and later became a leading citizen of
the community. The elder Reagan was fatally injured
when a heavy wind blew the limb from a tree
on him, reminding the little community once more
of the precarious nature of survival in this free, stern
country.</p>

<p>Maples, Clabos, and Trenthams followed the Ogles
and the Reagans into the Gatlinburg area. Nearby
Big Greenbrier Cove became known as “the Whaley
Settlement.” Some settlers traveled directly across
the crest of the Smokies, via Indian and Newfound
Gaps, but these old Cherokee trails and cattle paths
were rough and overgrown. Horses could barely
make it through, and most possessions had to be
carried on stout human shoulders. Besides the usual
pots, tools, guns, and seeds were the Bibles and
treasured manmade mementos.</p>

<p>Many settlers, having been soldiers of the
Revolution, had received 20-hectare (50-acre) land
grants for a mere 75 cents. They pushed along the
West Prong of the Little Pigeon River, past
Gatlinburg, up among the steep slopes of the Bull
Head, the Chimney Tops, the Sugarland Mountain.
This narrow Sugarlands valley, strewn with water-smoothed
boulders and homestead-sized plateaus of
level land, attracted dozens of families. But this rocky
country forced the settlers to clear their fields twice,
first of the forest and then of the stones.</p>

<p>The work of clearing demanded strong muscles,
long hours, and sturdy spirits. It meant denting the
hard armor of the forest and literally fighting for a
tiny patch of cropland. Men axed the huge trees with
stroke after grinding stroke, then either wrenched
the stumps from the earth with teams of oxen or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
burned them when they had dried. Some trees were
so immense that all a man could do was “girdle”
them, which meant deep-cutting a fatal circle into
the bark to arrest the flow of sap. Such “deadenings”
might stand for years with crops planted on the “new
ground,” before the trees were finally cut and often
burned. Logs and stumps from the virgin forest often
smouldered for days or weeks.</p>

<p>The soil itself was rich and loamy with the topsoil
of centuries. Land that had produced great forests
could also nourish fine crops. During the first year of
settlement, all able-bodied members of the family
helped cultivate the new ground. Such land demanded
particular attention. Using a single-pointed
“Bull tongue” plow to bite deep into the earth and a
sharp iron “coulter” to cut tough roots left under the
massive stumps, a succession of plows, horses, and
workers prepared and turned the newly cleared field.
The first man “laid off” the rows into evenly spaced
lengths, the second plowed an adjacent furrow, and
the wife or children dropped in the seed. A third
plow covered this planted row by furrowing along its
side. A short while later, the same workers would
“bust middles” by plowing three extra furrows into
the ground between the seeded rows. This loosened
the soil and destroyed any remaining roots.</p>

<p>While fields throughout the Smokies were yielding
to the plow, even more isolated coves and creeks
were being penetrated and settled. Gunters, Webbs,
McGahas, and Suttons found their way into Big
Creek. And in 1818, John Oliver walked into a secluded
Tennessee cove, spent the night in an Indian
hut, and then became familiar with one of the most
beautiful and productive spots in all the Great
Smokies. This broad, well-watered basin of fertile
land was named after the wife of an old Cherokee
chief; it was called Kate’s Cove, later Cades Cove.</p>

<p>John Oliver settled in that cove. Three years
later—two years after the decisive 1819 treaty with
the Cherokees—William Tipton settled there legally,
bought up most of the land, and parceled it out to
paying newcomers. David Foute came and established
an iron forge in 1827. By mixing iron ore with
limestone and charcoal, this “bloomery forge” produced
chunks of iron called “blooms.” The forge,
similar to many which sprang up throughout
Appalachia, was indeed an asset, but its low-grade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
ore and the cost of charcoal forced it to close only 20
years later.</p>


<p>Russell Gregory built a homestead high in the
cove and ranged cattle on a nearby grassy bald.
These mysterious open meadows scattered throughout
the Smokies were of unknown origin. Had Indians
kept them cleared in years gone by? Had some
unexplained natural circumstance created them? Pioneers
and later experts alike remained baffled and
attracted by the lush grass which, growing among
forest-covered crags and pinnacles, provided excellent
forage for livestock. The present-day Parson’s
and Gregory Balds were named for enterprising
farmers who made early use of this phenomenon.
Peter Cable, a friend of William Tipton, joined the
valley settlement in Cades Cove. Cable’s son-in-law,
Dan Lawson, expanded Cable’s holdings into a narrow
mountain-to-mountain empire.</p>

<p>Cades Cove, with its vast farmland, soon rivaled
Oconaluftee and Cataloochee. The lower end of the
cove sometimes became swampy, but this pasture
was reclaimed by a series of dikes and log booms. To
escape an 1825 epidemic of typhoid in the Tennessee
lowlands, Robert Shields and his family moved up
into the hill-guarded cove. Two of his sons married
John Oliver’s daughters and remained in Cades Cove.
A community had been formed.</p>

<p>But the life in these small communities was not
easy. Each family farmed for a living; each family
homestead provided for its own needs and such luxuries
as it could create. Isolation from outside markets
made cash crops, and hence cash itself,
relatively insignificant. The settlers of the Great
Smokies depended upon themselves. They built their
own cabins and corncribs, their own meat- and apple- and
spring-houses. They cultivated a garden whose
corn, potatoes, and other vegetables would last the
family through the winter. They set about insuring a
continuous supply of pork and fruit and grains, wool
and sometimes cotton, and all the other commodities
necessary to keep a family alive.</p>

<p>Living off the land required both labor and
ingenuity. These early settlers did not mind fishing
and hunting for food throughout the spring, summer,
and early fall, but there were also the demands of
farming and livestock raising. They carved out of
wood such essentials as ox yokes and wheat cradles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
spinning wheels and looms. Men patiently rebuilt
and repaired anything from a broken harness to a
sagging “shake” roof made of hand-riven shingles.
Children picked quantities of wild berries and bushels
of beans in sun-hot fields and gathered eggs from
hidden hen nests in barn lofts and under bushes.
They found firewood for the family, carried water
from the spring, bundled fodder from cane and corn,
and stacked hay for the cattle, horses, mules, and
oxen.</p>

</div>

<p>Women made sure that the food supply stretched
to last through the winter. They helped salt and cure
pork from the hogs that their husbands slaughtered.
They employed a variety of methods to preserve
vital fruits and vegetables. Apples, as well as beans,
were carefully dried in the hot summer or autumn
sun; water, added months later, would restore a
tangy flavor. Some foods were pickled in brine or
vinegar.</p>

<p>Women also used sulphur as a preservative, especially
with apples. Called simply “fruit” by the early
settlers, apples such as the favorite Limbertwigs and
Milams gave both variety and nutrition to the pioneer
diet. A woman might peel and slice as much as
two dishpans of “fruit” into a huge barrel. She would
then lay a pan of sulphur on top of the apples and
light the contents. By covering the barrel with a
clean cloth, she could regulate the right amount of
fumes held inside. The quickly sulfurated apples
remained white all winter and were considered a
delicacy by every mountain family.</p>

<p>Food, clothing, shelter, and incessant labor: these
essentials formed only the foundation of a life. Intangible
forces hovered at the edges and demanded
fulfillment. As hardy and practical as the physical
existence of the pioneers had to be, there was another
dimension to life. The pioneers were human
beings. Often isolated, sometimes lonely, they
yearned for the comforts of myth and superstition
and religion—and the roads that led in and out. The
Cherokees in their time had created such comforts;
they had woven their myths and had laced the
Smokies with a network of trails. Now it was the
white man’s turn.</p>

<p>The early settlers of the Great Smoky Mountains
were not content to remain only in their hidden
hollows and on their tiny homesteads. Challenging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the mountain ranges and the rough terrain, they
constructed roads. In the mid-1830s, a project was
undertaken to lay out a road across the crest of the
Smokies and connect North Carolina’s Little Tennessee
valley with potential markets in Knoxville,
Tennessee. Although the North Carolina section was
never completed, an old roadbed from Cades Cove
to Spence Field is still in existence. When Julius
Gregg established a licensed distillery in Cades Cove
and processed brandy from apples and corn, farmers
built a road from the cove down Tabcat Creek to the
vast farmlands along the Little Tennessee River.</p>

<p>By far the most ambitious road project was the
Oconaluftee Turnpike. In 1832, the North Carolina
legislature chartered the Oconaluftee Turnpike
Company. Abraham Enloe, Samuel Sherrill, John
Beck, John Carroll, and Samuel Gibson were commissioners
for the road and were authorized to sell
stock and collect tolls. The road itself was to run
from Oconaluftee all the way to the top of the
Smokies at Indian Gap.</p>

<p>Work on the road progressed slowly. Bluffs and
cliffs had to be avoided; such detours lengthened the
turnpike considerably. Sometimes the rock was difficult
to remove. Crude blasting—complete with hand-hammered
holes, gunpowder inside hollow reeds,
and fuses of straw or leaves—constituted one quick
and sure, but more expensive, method. Occasionally,
the men burned logs around the rock, then quickly
showered it with creek water. When the rock split
from the sudden change in temperature, it could
then be quarried and graded out. Throughout the
1830s, residents of Oconaluftee and nearby valleys
toiled and sweated to lay down this single roadbed.</p>

<p>This desire and effort to conquer the wilderness
also prompted the establishment of churches and, to
a lesser extent, schools. In the Tennessee Sugarlands,
services were held under the trees until a small building
was constructed at the beginning of the 19th
century. The valley built a larger five-cornered Baptist
church in 1816. Prospering Cades Cove established
a Methodist church in 1830; its preacher rode
the Little River circuit. Five years later, the church
had 40 members.</p>

<p>Over on the Oconaluftee, Ralph Hughes had donated
land and Dr. John Mingus had built a log
schoolhouse. Monthly prayer meetings were held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
there until the Lufty Baptist Church was officially
organized in 1836. Its 21 charter members included
most of the turnpike commissioners plus the large
Mingus family. Five years later, the members built a
log church at Smokemont on land donated by John
Beck.</p>

<p>Nothing fostered these settlers’ early gropings toward
community more than stories. Legends and tall
tales, begun in family conversations and embellished
by neighborly rumor, forged a bond, a unity of
interest, a common history, in each valley and on
each meandering branch. For example, in one western
North Carolina tradition that would thrive well
into the 20th century, Abraham Enloe was cited as
the real father of Abraham Lincoln. Nancy Hanks, it
was asserted, had worked for a time in the Enloe
household and had become pregnant. Exiled to
Kentucky, she married Thomas Lincoln but gave
birth to Abraham’s child.</p>

<p>Stories mingled with superstition. The Cherokees
dropped seven grains into every corn hill and never
thinned their crop. Many early settlers of the
Smokies believed that if corn came up missing in
spots, some of the family would die within a year.
Just as the Cherokees forbade counting green melons
or stepping across the vines because “it would
make the vines wither,” the Smokies settlers looked
upon certain events as bad omens. A few days before
Richard Reagan’s skull was fractured, a bird flew on
the porch where he sat and came to rest on his head.
Reagan himself saw it as a “death sign.”</p>

<p>Superstition, combined with Indian tradition, led
to a strangely exact form of medicine. One recipe for
general aches and pains consisted of star root,
sourwood, rosemary, sawdust, anvil dust, water, and
vinegar. A bad memory required a properly “sticky”
tea made of cocklebur and jimsonweed.</p>

<p>A chief medicinal herb was an unusual wild plant
known as ginseng. Called “sang” in mountain
vernacular, its value lay in the manlike shape of its
dual-pronged roots. Oriental cultures treasured
ginseng, especially the older and larger roots. Reputed
to cure anything from a cough to a boil to an
internal disorder, it was also considered an aphrodisiac
and a source of rare, mystical properties. But
scientific research has never yielded any hard evidence
of its medicinal worth.</p>

<p>Settlers used ginseng sparingly, for it brought a
high price when sold to herb-dealers for shipment to
China. The main problem lay in locating the five-leaved
plants, which grew in the most secluded,
damp coves of the Smokies. Sometimes several members
of a family would wait until summer or early
fall, then go out on extended “sanging” expeditions.</p>

<p>The search was not easy. During some seasons,
the plant might not appear at all. When it did, its
leaves yellowed and its berries reddened for only a
few days. But when a healthy “sang” plant was finally
found, and its long root carefully cleaned and dried,
it could yield great financial reward. Although the
5-year-old white root was more common, a red-rooted
plant needed a full decade to mature and was
therefore especially prized. Greed often led to wanton
destruction of the beds, with no seed-plants for
future harvests. Ginseng was almost impossible to
cultivate.</p>

<p>Ginseng-hunting became a dangerous business. Although
Daniel Boone dug it and traded in it, later
gatherers were sometimes killed over it. One large
Philadelphia dealer who came into Cataloochee in
the mid-1800s was murdered and robbed. Anyone
trying to grow it, even if he were successful, found
that he would have to guard the plants like water in a
desert. Indeed, the rare, graceful ginseng became a
symbol for many in the mountains of all that
was unique, so readily destroyed, and eventually
irreplaceable.</p>

<p>As much as the pioneers drew on Indian
experience, they also depended on their own resourcefulness.
One skill which the early settlers
brought with them into the Smoky Mountains involved
a power unknown to the Cherokees. This was
the power of the rifle: both its manufacture and the
knowledge of what the rifle could do.</p>

<p>The backwoods rifle was a product of the early
American frontier. Formally known as the “Pennsylvania-Kentucky”
rifle, this long-barreled innovation
became a standby throughout the Appalachians. To
assure precise workmanship, it was made out of the
softest iron available. The inside of the barrel, or the
bore, was painstakingly “rifled” with spiralling
grooves. This gradual twist made the bullet fly harder
and aim straighter toward its target. The butt of the
weapon was crescent-shaped to keep the gun from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
slipping. All shiny or highly visible metal was
blackened, and sometimes a frontiersman would rub
his gun barrel with a dulling stain or crushed leaf.</p>


<p>But the trademark of the “long rifle” was just that:
its length. Weighing over 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds)
and measuring more than 1.2 meters (4 feet), the
barrel of the backwoods rifle could be unbalancing.
Yet this drawback seemed minor compared to the
superior accuracy of the new gun. The heavy barrel
could take a much heavier powder charge than the
lighter barrels, and this in turn could, as an expert
noted, “drive the bullet faster, lower the trajectory,
make the ball strike harder, and cause it to flatten
out more on impact. It does not cause inaccurate
flight....”</p>

</figure>

<p>The Pennsylvania-Kentucky rifle became defender,
gatherer of food, companion for thousands
of husbands and fathers. Cradled on a rack of whittled
wooden pegs or a buck’s antlers, the “rifle-gun”
hung over the door or along the wall or above the
“fire-board,” as the mantel was called, within easy
and ready reach. It was the recognized symbol of the
fact that each man’s cabin was his castle.</p>

<p>Equipped with a weapon such as this, pioneer
Americans pushed back the frontier. The fastnesses
of the Great Smoky Mountains gradually submitted
to the probing and settling of the white man. The
fertile valleys were settled, the hidden coves were
conquered. The Oconaluftee Turnpike to the top of
the Smokies was completed in 1839. And in that
fateful year, disaster was stalking a people who had
known the high mountains but who had not known
of the ways of making a rifle.</p>

<p>Of all the special tasks in the
Great Smoky Mountains, rifle
making was perhaps the
most intricate and the most
intriguing. From the forging
of the barrel to the filing of
the double trigger and the
carving of the stock, the construction
of the “long rifle”
proved to be a process both
painstaking and exciting. After
the barrel was shaped on
the anvil, its bore was cleaned
to a glass-like finish by inserting
and turning an iron rod
with steel cutters. When the
rod could cut no more, the
shavings from the bore were
removed. The rifling of the
barrel, or cutting the necessary
twists into the bore, required
a 3-meters-long (10-foot)
assembly, complete with
barrel, cutting rod, and rifling
guide. The 1.5-meter (5-foot)
wooden guide, whose
parallel twists had been carefully
cut into it with a knife,
could be turned by a man
pushing it through the spiral-edged
hole of a stationary
“head block.” The resulting
force and spin drove the cutting
rod and its tiny saw into
the barrel, guiding its movement
as it “rifled” the gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i061_1.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Most of the rifles in the
Smokies had an average spin
or twist of about one turn in
122 centimeters (48 inches),
the ordinary original length
of the barrel. A later step—“dressing
out” the barrel with
a greased hickory stick and a
finishing saw—usually took a
day and a half to be done
right. Likewise, the making
of a maple or walnut rifle
stock, or the forging of the
bullet mold, led gunsmiths to
adopt the long view of time
and the passing of days in the
Great Smoky Mountains.
Two such gunsmiths were
Matt Ownby and Wiley Gibson.
Ownby (<a href="#i060_1">far left</a>) fits a
barrel to an unfinished stock
as the process of rifle making
nears its end. Gibson (<a href="#i060_2">below</a>),
the last of four generations of
famous Smoky Mountain
gunsmiths, works at his forge
in Sevier County, Tennessee.
Over the years Gibson lived
in several places in Sevier
County, and in each one he
set up a gun shop. As he
tested one of his finished
products (<a href="#i061_1">left</a>), Gibson commented:
“I can knock a squirrel
pine blank out of a tree at
60 yards.”</p>

</div>


<p>The Cherokees who remained in the East endured
many changes in the early 1800s.</p>

<p>As their Nation dwindled in size to cover only
portions of Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, and
Tennessee, the influence of growing white settlements
began to encroach on the old ways, the accepted
beliefs. Settlers intermarried with Indians.
Aspects of the Nation’s civilization gradually grew to
resemble that of the surrounding states.</p>

<p>The Cherokees diversified and improved their agricultural
economy. They came to rely more heavily
on livestock. Herds of sheep, goats, and hogs, as well
as cattle, grazed throughout the Nation. Along with
crops of aromatic tobacco, and such staples as
squash, potatoes, beans, and the ever-present corn,
the Cherokees were cultivating cotton, grains, indigo,
and other trade items. Boats carried tons of export
to New Orleans and other river cities. Home industry,
such as spinning and weaving, multiplied; local merchants
thrived.</p>

<p>Church missions and their attendant schools were
established. As early as 1801, members of the Society
of United Brethren set up a station of missionaries
at a north Georgia site called Spring Place.
And within five years, the Rev. Gideon Blackburn
from East Tennessee persuaded his Presbyterians to
subsidize two schools.</p>

<p>In 1817, perhaps the most famous of all the Cherokee
missions was opened on Chickamauga Creek at
Brainerd, just across the Tennessee line from
Georgia. Founded by Cyrus Kingsbury and a combined
Congregational-Presbyterian board, Brainerd
Mission educated many Cherokee leaders, including
Elias Boudinot and John Ridge. Samuel Austin
Worcester, a prominent Congregational minister
from New England, taught at Brainerd from 1825
until 1834. He became a great friend of the Cherokees
and was referred to as “The Messenger.”</p>

<p>In 1821, a single individual gave to his Nation an
educational innovation as significant and far-reaching
as the influx of schools. A Cherokee named
Sequoyah, known among whites as George Gist, had
long been interested in the “talking leaves” of the
white man. After years of thought, study, and hard
work, he devised an 86-character Cherokee alphabet.
Born about 1760 near old Fort Loudoun, Tennessee,
Sequoyah had neither attended school nor learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
English. By 1818, he had moved to Willstown in what
is now eastern Alabama and had grown interested in
the white man’s ability to write. He determined that
he would give his own people the same advantage.</p>

<p><i>Sequoyah displays the Cherokee
alphabet he developed.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The first painstaking process he tried called for
attaching a mark to each Cherokee word. These
marks soon mounted into the thousands. As he
sensed the futility of this one-for-one relationship, he
examined English letters in an old newspaper. His
own mind linked symbols of this sort with basic
sounds of the Cherokee tongue. After months of
work, he sorted out these sounds and assigned them
symbols based, to a large extent, upon the ones he
had seen in the newspaper. When he introduced his
invention to his fellow Cherokees, it was as if he had
loosed a floodgate. Within the space of a few weeks,
elders and children alike began to read and write.
The change was incredible.</p>

<p>Sequoyah himself vaulted into a position of great
respect inside the Nation. One of his many awestruck
visitors, John Howard Payne, described him with the
finest detail and noted that Sequoyah wore</p>

<p>“... <i>a turban of roses and posies upon a white ground
girding his venerable grey hairs, a long dark blue
robe, bordered around the lower edge and the cuffs,
with black; a blue and white minutely checked calico
tunic under it, confined with an Indian beaded
belt, which sustained a large wooden handled knife,
in a rough leathern sheath; the tunic open on the
breast and its collar apart, with a twisted handkerchief
flung around his neck and gathered within the
bosom of the tunic. He wore plain buckskin leggings;
and one of a deeper chocolate hue than the other.
His moccasins were unornamented buckskin. He had
a long dusky white bag of sumac with him, and a
long Indian pipe, and smoked incessantly, replenishing
his pipe from his bag. His air was altogether what
we picture to ourselves of an old Greek philosopher.
He talked and gesticulated very gracefully; his voice
alternately swelling, and then sinking to a whisper,
and his eye firing up and then its wild flashes subsiding
into a gentle and most benignant smile.</i>”</p>

<p>During the 1820s, Sequoyah moved west to
Arkansas. Preoccupied with the legend of a lost
band of Cherokees somewhere in the Rocky
Mountains, he initiated several attempts to discover
the group. But age caught up with him. He died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
alone in northern Mexico in the summer of 1843. He
had brought his Nation a long way. His name would
be immortalized in the great redwood tree of the Far
West, the giant sequoia. And in a sense his spirit
lived on in the first Cherokee newspaper—the
<i>Cherokee Phoenix</i>—which was established in 1828
at New Echota, with Elias Boudinot as its editor and
Samuel Worcester as its business manager.</p>

<p>The Cherokees also made remarkable changes in
government. In 1808, they adopted a written legal
code; a dozen years later, they divided the Nation
into judicial districts and designated judges. The first
Supreme Court of the Cherokees was established in
1822, and by 1827 the Nation had drawn up an
American-based Constitution. The president of the
constitutional convention was a 37-year-old leader
named John Ross. A year later, he began a 40-year
term as principal chief of his people.</p>

<p>But whatever the progress of the internal affairs of
the Cherokee Nation, political relations with the
United States steadily disintegrated. Although the
first quarter of the 19th century saw a sympathetic
man, Return Jonathan Meigs, serve as America’s
southern Indian agent, even he and his position could
not prevent the relentless pursuit of Indian territory.</p>

<p>In 1802 and 1803, the U.S. Government set a
dangerous precedent for the Cherokees. In return
for Georgia’s abandonment of her claims to the Mississippi
Territory, the United States agreed to extinguish
all Indian titles for lands lying within Georgia.
This indicated that the government was no longer
prepared to defend the Cherokee Nation.</p>

<p>President Thomas Jefferson acted to alleviate
some of the Cherokee loss. He suggested a program
of removal west to a portion of the newly acquired
Louisiana Purchase. Most Cherokees hated the plan,
yet some harassed bands made the trip to what is
now Arkansas. The foot was in the door; hereafter,
the government could point to a few Cherokees in
Arkansas and direct others there. Even though 800
eastern Cherokee warriors fought alongside Americans
during the War of 1812, the United States came
to recognize only the government of the Cherokees
West.</p>

<p>But what of the Cherokees East? They waited.
They pursued daily routines while the pressures
around them gathered and grew. And by 1828, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
pressures had reached a degree which showed the
Cherokees that the final crush was on.</p>

his opposition to the removal
of the Cherokees. He was in
the last group to leave.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>It began inside the Nation. In the winter of 1828,
an old Cherokee councilman, Whitepath, rose up in
rebellion against the new constitution. Suspicious of
the Nation’s whirlwind progress, fearful of the
Nation’s stormy enemies, Whitepath attempted to
persuade his 15,000 countrymen to hold fast to the
ways of the past. He assembled a series of localized
meetings, where he advocated the abandonment of
white religion, society, economy. He called for a
return to tribal organization, but his call fell on
younger ears and his plan was doomed to failure.</p>

<p>The Cherokees turned to John Ross for leadership.
Like Sequoyah, John Ross possessed both grace
and ability. These assets, combined with courage,
enabled him to accomplish seemingly remote goals
for his people. This handsome statesman, educated
by his own father, represented the middle ground of
Cherokee policy. Though refusing the reactionism
of a Whitepath, John Ross also rejected any proposal
to move west. For he knew that his people had lived
here in the Smokies and belonged here, and he would
not have them forced from their homeland.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson would. This stern Tennessee soldier
and politician began his career as a headlong
Indian fighter and never lost the zeal. Although Jackson
the soldier had been aided numerous times by
Cherokee warriors, Jackson the politician was determined
to move the Cherokees west. And in the
watershed years of 1828 and 1829, Andrew Jackson
was elected and sworn in as President of the United
States.</p>

<p>Events conspired against the Nation. In July of
1829, in what is now known as Lumpkin County,
Georgia, a few shiny nuggets of gold were discovered
on Ward’s Creek of the Chestatee River. Within
days, fortune hunters swarmed into the territory;
more than 10,000 gold-seekers squatted on Cherokee
lands, disregarded Cherokee rights, and pillaged
Cherokee homes. With Jackson’s support, the Georgia
legislature passed laws confiscating Indian land,
nullifying Indian law, and prohibiting Indian assembly.
By the end of 1829, the script for Cherokee removal
had been blazoned in gold.</p>

<p>But there was more. Andrew Jackson asked Congress
for “a general removal law” that would give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
him prime authority in the matter at the same time
that it formed the basis for future treaty negotiation.
Congress passed the Removal Act, which included a
half-million dollar appropriation for that purpose, in
May of 1830. Davy Crockett, whose legendary exploits
and down-to-earth compassion made him perhaps
the best representative of the mountain spirit,
was a U.S. congressman at the time. Although his
grandfather had been murdered by Dragging Canoe,
Davy Crockett argued against and voted against the
bill. He was the only Tennessean to do so, and he
was defeated when he ran for reelection.</p>

were “executed” on June 22,
1839.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Cherokee leaders sought help from the U.S.
courts. Their friend and missionary, sober and troubled
Samuel Worcester, fell victim to a Georgia law
“prohibiting the unauthorized residence of white men
within the Cherokee Nation.” Worcester appealed to
the Supreme Court, which in February of 1832 considered
the case of <i>Worcester v. Georgia</i>. On March
3, a feeble Chief Justice John Marshall read the
Court’s decision to a packed room: all the Georgia
laws against the Cherokee Nation were declared
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Elias Boudinot, editor of the <i>Phoenix</i> and a special
friend of Worcester, wrote to his brother and expressed
the Nation’s joy and relief:</p>

<p>“<i>It is glorious news. The laws of the state are declared
by the highest judicial tribunal in the country
to be</i> null and void. <i>It is a great triumph on the part
of the Cherokees.... The question is forever settled
as to who is right and who is wrong.</i>”</p>

<p>Yet Andrew Jackson would not stand for such a
settlement. “John Marshall has made his decision,”
Jackson thundered, “now let him enforce it.” This
was the single instance in American history where
the President so bluntly and openly defied a Supreme
Court ruling. The situation grew more bleak.
Worcester was released from jail only after appealing
to the “good will” of the state of Georgia. Matters
worsened as Georgia conducted its Cherokee
Lottery of 1832, and thousands of white men
descended onto lots carved out of the Cherokee
land.</p>




<p>Boudinot and several other Cherokee leaders, including
John Ridge, grew discouraged to the point of
resignation. Jackson’s attitude as President, coupled
with Georgia’s unrelenting attack and the Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Court’s inability to stop it, caused a change of heart
in Boudinot and Ridge. Boudinot stepped down from
the <i>Phoenix</i> and, with Major Ridge, became an important
spokesman for a minority faction of Cherokees
which was prepared to move west. However,
John Ross continued to speak for the vast majority
who rejected any discussion of removal.</p>

<p>By 1835, the rift between the Ridge party and John
Ross’ followers had become open and intense. Seeking
to take advantage of this division, Jackson appointed
a New York minister, J.F. Schermerhorn, to
deal with Boudinot and Ridge. The Cherokee supporters
of Ross hated this “loose Dutch Presbyterian
minister” and referred to him as “The Devil’s Horn.”</p>

<p>On several occasions, Ross attempted to negotiate
a reasonable solution with Washington. He was frustrated
at every turn. In November of 1835, he and
the visiting John Howard Payne were arrested by the
Georgia militia. In jail, Payne heard a Georgia guard
singing “Home Sweet Home” outside his cell. Payne
asked the man if he knew that his prisoner had
written the song; the guard seemed unimpressed.
After spending nine days in jail, Ross and Payne
were released without any explanation for their
treatment.</p>

<p>Ross traveled on to Washington to resume negotiations.
While he was there, Schermerhorn and
the Ridge party drew up and signed a treaty. Endorsed
by a scant one-tenth of the Nation’s 16,000
Cherokees, this treaty ceded to the United States all
eastern territory in exchange for $5 million and a
comparable amount of western land. Cherokees
throughout the Nation registered shock and betrayal;
Boudinot and Ridge, their lives already threatened
numerous times, would be murdered within four
years. Yet despite Ross’ protestations of fraud, the
U.S. Senate ratified the minority Treaty of New
Echota by one vote. A new President, Martin Van
Buren, authorized Gen. Winfield Scott to begin the
removal of all Cherokees in the summer of 1838.</p>

<p>Scott, while determined to carry out the removal,
tried in vain to restrain his troops from inflicting
undue hardships. Scott’s soldiers moved relentlessly
through the Nation. As one private remembered it in
later years:</p>

<p>“<i>Men working in the fields were arrested and driven
to the stockades. Women were dragged from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
homes by soldiers whose language they could not
understand. Children were often separated from their
parents and driven into the stockades with the sky
for a blanket and earth for a pillow.</i>”</p>

<p>The soldiers built 13 stockades in North Carolina,
Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama. Using these as
base camps, they scattered throughout the countryside
with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets. As they
herded Indians back toward the forts, bands of roving
outlaws burned the homes, stole the livestock,
robbed the graves. Throughout the summer, a stifling
drought settled over the hot, depleted Nation.
By August, many of the captured Cherokees had
succumbed to sickness or even death.</p>

<p>Removal itself began during the autumn. A few
early contingents had been moved out along the
Tennessee River in large two-decker keelboats. The
majority would travel overland. Thirteen detachments
of about 1,000 each, plus 645 wagons carrying
the sick and aged, departed from southeastern
Tennessee. Early on in their journey, the weather
changed. Winter stalked the doomed procession with
the tenacity of a bloodhound. By the time the Cherokees
crossed the Mississippi River many had died
because of lack of food and warmth. In March of
1839, the dwindling band reached what is now
Oklahoma. Four thousand Cherokees, almost one-third
of all who left their mountain homeland, had
been taken by the cold, hard hand of death.</p>

<p>The tragedy would be recorded in history as the
“Trail of Tears.” Along the route, old Whitepath
died. The wife of John Ross gave her blanket to a
sick child and herself suffered fatal exposure. A
white Georgia volunteer summarized the needless
pain in one short sentence: “That Cherokee removal
was the crudest work I ever knew.” But disaster was
not the final conqueror. For out of that cruelty came
sacrifice; out of that death came rebirth.</p>

the famous Cherokee
chief and spokesman
who stayed with the small
group in the Great Smoky
Mountains.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The improbable source of that rebirth was a
farmer named Tsali. Old Man Charley. Until October
of 1838, he was simply another Indian to be
herded to the stockade. A lieutenant and three other
soldiers were assigned to capture all Cherokees along
the headwaters of the Oconaluftee. As the patrol
traveled up the Little Tennessee River, it rounded up
Tsali, his family, and a few friends. The soldiers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>prodded the Indians with bayonets and forced Tsali’s
wife to hasten her steps. Driven to anger and
desperation, Tsali called the other warriors to action.
In the quick, sudden tangle that followed, at least
one soldier was killed. Tsali and his small band fled
across the river high into the Great Smoky
Mountains. They hid in a massive rock shelter at the
head of Deep Creek. Located on top of a steep cliff,
the actual camping place lay in the midst of
extensive, thick laurel and hemlock “roughs.” Several
hundred other Cherokees escaped from the soldiers
or the stockades and found similar hiding places
on the rugged, overgrown sides of the Smokies. Most
of them lasted out the winter, subsisting at a
near-starvation level on roots, herbs, nuts, and small
game.</p>


<p>Confronted with such determination and the likelihood
of a prolonged, wearisome mission of search
and arrest in the rugged mountains, General Scott
offered a compromise. If Tsali and his small party
would come down and give themselves up for
punishment, the rest of the Cherokee fugitives would
be allowed to stay in the mountains until a solution
could be reached by all sides. Scott sent W. H.
Thomas, a white man who had grown up with the
Cherokees, into the Smokies to present the terms.
Thomas found Tsali, who silently listened and decided
on his own accord to accompany Thomas out
of the mountains. Early in the year of 1839, Tsali and
his brother and his eldest son were shot by a firing
squad. The youngest son, Wasituna (for Washington)
was left to take word of the deaths back to the
Cherokees who remained in their hills.</p>

<p>They had held onto their homeland in the Great
Smoky Mountains. By nothing more than the thin
grip of desperate determination, they had held on,
and they would remain. Reinforced by General
Scott’s promise, scattered friends in the East, and
Thomas’ political negotiations with Washington and
North Carolina, the Cherokee remnant soon became
the Eastern Band. Their homeland would now be
known as the Qualla Reservation. So the Cherokees
East, along with the white pioneers of the Great
Smokies, turned together to brace the mountainous
challenge of the 19th century.</p>

<p>While events of the early 19th century in the surrounding
southland and the nation were moving
inexorably toward conflict on bloody battlefields to
decide issues which could not or would not be resolved
in the political arena, people in the Great
Smokies were pursuing their struggle to survive and
adapt to their stern and splendid surroundings.</p>

<p>The early explorers, the long hunters, the initial
homesteaders, the trailblazers and the groundbreakers—these
had forever set a human seal upon the
wilderness. Now it was the time of pioneer becoming
mountaineer. Henceforth, as new settlers or curious
travelers or specialized seekers in a dozen fields
made their way into the mountains, they would find
someone already there to welcome them.</p>

<p>That “someone” was becoming known by terms
which might alternately serve as a source of
description, derision, or definition. Highlander.
Hillbilly. Mountaineer. The least offensive word was
“highlander,” with its overtones of the misty Scottish
landscape and fierce clan loyalties from which many
of the Smokies’ family lines had recently descended.
“Mountaineer” varied. Used to denote the proud
individualism that characterized many of the stalwart
men and women whose roots held deep and fast
in this isolated place, “mountaineer” was a strong,
acceptable name. But turned into a catchword for
some picturesque, inadequate character who divided
his time between the homemade dulcimer and the
home-run distillery, “mountaineer” was suspect.
“Hillbilly” came to verge on insult, as it conjured up
cartoons of lanky, sub-human creatures who were
quick to feud, slow to work, and often indifferent to
the “progress” by which helpful visitors would like to
transform mountain lives and attitudes.</p>

<p>Of course, the trouble with any single word that
tried to summarize these complex and distinctive
lives was its limited ability to convey more than a
stereotype or a single facet. Yet the 19th and early
20th centuries saw the rise and wide adoption of
such terms, with an accompanying unease—sometimes
outrage—on the part of those described. This
tension has persisted into the present day, for Southern
Appalachian natives often have felt they have
been misunderstood, or exploited, by the curious
outlanders.</p>

<p>The visitors indeed were curious—curious about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]
</span>
mountain people but also about topography, altitudes,
plants, wildlife, and the rich variety of natural
resources abounding throughout these hills. Naturalists
and botanists followed the lead of Frenchman
André Michaux and Philadelphian William Bartram,
who had come collecting plants in the Southern
mountains during the previous century. It was
Michaux who had told mountain herb-gatherers
about ginseng’s commercial value, and Bartram who
had discovered and described the showy flame azalea
brightening the spring woods.</p>

<p>Among 19th-century arrivals, S. B. Buckley wrote
the earliest comprehensive botanical report of the
Great Smokies. He marveled at that scenery,
“surpassing anything we remember to have seen
among the White Mountains of New Hampshire,”
and at the variety of flora. “Here,” he wrote in the
mid-1800s, “is a strange admixture of Northern and
Southern species of plants, while there are quite a
number which have been found in no other section
of the world.” Later naturalists would share his enthusiasm
and enlarge on his studies.</p>

<p>Journalists came. One was a reporter named
Charles Lanman, secretary to Daniel Webster, who
rode through the hills in 1848 and wrote a book
called <i>Letters from the Alleghany Mountains</i>.
Through his descriptive adventures readers had a
glimpse into a region more remote to their experience
than many foreign countries. If the Smokies
were described by him as one large upthrust, perhaps
that was because he saw the range through a
purple haze. He wrote at one point:</p>

<p>“<i>This mountain is the loftiest of a large brotherhood
which lies crowded together between North Carolina
and Tennessee. Its height cannot be less than
five thousand feet above the level of the sea ... and
all I can say of its panorama is that I can conceive of
nothing more grand and imposing.</i>”</p>

<p>Lanman was only the first of many writers who
would come seeking high adventure and good copy,
but his lack of exactitude about the physical features
of the mountains was soon to be remedied by another
group of visitors. Some scientists could not be
content with hunters’ yarns and the poetic prose of
journalists; they wanted precise facts and figures by
which both native and stranger could better appreciate
the landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>One of these was Thomas Lanier Clingman, whose
career included being a U.S. senator and a Confederate
general as well as a scientist. A contemporary
historian described him as being arrogant, aggressive,
with “more than common ability” but limited scientific
knowledge, whose chief service lay in arousing
public curiosity in the mountains, mineralogy, and
geography. He became involved in a scholarly feud
with Dr. Elisha Mitchell, a transplanted Connecticut
professor at the University of North Carolina, over
which peak constituted the highest point east of the
Mississippi River. While they were trying to settle
the question, Mitchell was killed in an accidental fall
on the slopes of the North Carolina pinnacle which
later was given his name. Clingman’s name came to
grace the mountain he had explored and measured:
2,025-meter (6,643-foot)-high Clingmans Dome on
the crest of the Great Smokies, only 13 meters (43
feet) lower than the lofty Mt. Mitchell.</p>

<p>The most fascinated and impressive visitor during
these years of the mid-19th century came from another
mountain terrain. Arnold Guyot, remembered
today by the peak at the eastern end of the Great
Smokies which bears his name, was born in
Switzerland in 1807. His studies in physical geography
had won him distinction throughout Europe before
he came to America and accepted a chair at
Princeton University in 1854. Paul Fink, a historian
of the Great Smoky Mountains, has said that although
forerunners of Guyot glimpsed segments of
the Smokies and described certain details,</p>

<p>“<i>it remained for this man of foreign birth to penetrate
these mountains, spend months among them,
measure their heights for the first time, and have
drawn under his own direction the first map we have
showing the range in detail</i>.”</p>

<p>Clingman secured for his friend Guyot a local
guide named Robert Collins. The mountain man and
the professor struggled through the roughest laurel
“hells” and up the steepest slopes, measuring,
calibrating, and finally naming many of the unknown
heights. Guyot’s journals combined precision and
poetry, and they related the awesome Smokies to the
human scene in ways that had not been previously
possible. From that point on, natives and visitors
alike could both know and appreciate more of this
green homeland. But, as Paul Fink has pointed out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
“With Guyot’s labors the early explorations of the
Smokies ceased.”</p>

<p>Why? What happened to cut off so abruptly the
increasing flow of visitors to this virgin country? The
happening was war.</p>

<p>The Great Smokies country, with its upland farms
and small home crafts, was not in the mainstream of
the decisive struggle between a plantation South and
an industrial North. Nor was it in the mainstream of
the violent action that convulsed its surrounding
region. There had been slaves in some of the more
prosperous mountain households, but few citizens in
the Great Smokies area would have waged war either
to defend or abolish the peculiar institution.</p>

<p>What some did resist was being conscripted by
either side. “Scouting” became a well-used word defining
a new experience in the Smokies. It applied to
anyone hiding out in the hills to escape going into
the Confederate or the Union army. Secretly supplied
with food and clothes by their families and
sympathetic friends, such “scouts” could hold out
for years against the searches of outlander officials.
Sometimes they did in fact become scouts, guiding
escaped captives from Andersonville and other Confederate
prisons through the mountains toward
northern territory, and those fleeing from Yankee
prisons toward their southern homes.</p>

<p>Many of the mountain people, of course, followed
the example of their neighbors throughout the region
and put on the formal uniform of blue or gray.
There were sharp divisions within counties, towns,
and families in the choice between state and nation.
Perhaps no single section of the United States was as
bitterly torn in its allegiance.</p>

<p>Tennessee and North Carolina had long held
strong Union sentiments; but when Lincoln called
for troops in the aftermath of the firing on Fort
Sumter, the two states officially rallied to the Confederate
cause. North Carolinians, who had been notably
reluctant to leave the Union and who bristled at
the injustices of “a rich man’s war and a poor man’s
fight,” nonetheless sent more men to the Confederacy
than any other state. Many of these were western
North Carolinians, following the leadership of
their own Zebulon (Zeb) Baird Vance, born in Buncombe
County and occupying the governor’s chair
in Raleigh during the war. Yet the fact that adjoining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
East Tennessee was overwhelmingly Union—and
sent more men into the Federal forces than some of
the New England states—affected the North Carolinians
as well. With the two states’ actual secession
from the Union, numerous mountain pockets in effect
seceded from their states and chose to remain
loyal to the Union. Thus the little rebellion inside
the larger revolt compounded the agonizing conflict
of war and made every cove and community and
hearthside a potential battleground.</p>

<p>And no matter which army the men marched with,
their characteristics remained surprisingly intact.
The historian of one North Carolina Confederate
regiment described some of the soldiers from
Haywood County:</p>

<p>“<i>These mountain men had always been accustomed
to independence of thought and freedom of action,
and having elected for their company officers their
neighbors and companions, they had no idea of surrendering
more of their personal liberty than should
be necessary to make them effective soldiers. Obedient
while on duty and independent while off duty,
this spirit to a marked degree they retained to the
close of the war.</i>”</p>

<p>The experience of Radford Gatlin concentrated in
a single episode both the sharp divisions and the
ironies of war in the mountains. Gatlinburg, now a
commercial and flourishing tourist mecca at the edge
of the park, bears the name of a man who was driven
out of that town because of his unpopular stand
during the war. The sturdily built, enterprising, and
somewhat arrogant Gatlin was not a man to conceal
his beliefs. With his wife and a slave woman he had
come from North Carolina by way of Jefferson
County, Tennessee, to the community known as
White Oak Flats and had established a successful
general store and a less successful church: the New
Hampshire Baptist Gatlinites. When Dick Reagan
was appointed postmaster for a new postal service to
be established in White Oak Flats in 1860, the office
was located amidst the axes, guns, coffee, sugar, and
bells of Gatlin’s store, and Reagan renamed the post
office, and therefore the town, after his good friend
the storekeeper.</p>

<p>But when war came and Radford Gatlin not only
supported the Confederacy but made heated speeches
in its favor, the strongly Unionist villagers turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
against him. After being beaten by a band of masked
men, Gatlin abandoned his claim to thousands of
hectares that now lie within the park and departed
forever from the place that was to perpetuate his
name if not his memory.</p>

<p>The war’s severest hardships followed in the wake
of the outliers, or the bushwhackers. These scavengers
favored no cause. As the war dragged on, they
ambushed and raided, stealing meat from the
smokehouse, corn from the crib, and farm animals
from barn and pasture. Scarcity and want became
commonplace throughout the mountains. In North
Carolina’s Madison County, a group of citizens broke
into a warehouse and laid claim to a valuable
commodity, salt. Economic want enflamed political
emotions. In Tennessee’s Sevier County, controversial
“Parson” Brownlow, Methodist circuit-rider
turned newspaper editor turned politician, sought
refuge in the shadow of the Smokies with Unionist
sympathizers when Knoxville came under Confederate
control.</p>

<p>A well-known army unit operated in the Smokies:
Col. William Thomas’ Confederate 69th-N.C., known
as Thomas’ Legion of Indians and Highlanders.
“Little Will,” as he was affectionately called, had
become the effective spokesman in Washington and
at the state level for the eastern remnant of the
Cherokee. When the Civil War came and he chose
to stay with the South, the Cherokees chose to stay
with him. For a while, they secured mineral supplies
for the Confederacy, including alum and saltpeter
for gunpowder. The Legion guarded Alum Cave in
the Smokies. Under Thomas’ direction, his unit also
worked on the Oconaluftee Turnpike.</p>

<p>In December 1863, after Gen. Ambrose E.
Burnside had secured Knoxville for the Union, Col.
William J. Palmer and the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry
attacked Thomas’ camp near Gatlinburg. After a
short battle, Thomas and his troops retreated across
the mountains into North Carolina. One month later,
Confederate Gen. Robert P. Vance decided to remedy
the situation in the mountains. With 375 cavalry,
100 infantry, and artillery, he marched from
Asheville, joined Thomas and 150 Indian troops in
Quallatown, and crossed the Smokies during a
bitterly cold spell. While Thomas remained in
Gatlinburg, Vance proceeded toward Newport,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
camped on Cosby Creek deep in the Smokies, and
was surprised there by none other than Colonel
Palmer and his 15th-Pa. In the resulting rout, General
Vance was captured along with about everything
else: men, horses, medical supplies, food,
ammunition. In February, Thomas and his Legion
were engaged once more, in the Great Smoky Mountains
near the mouth of Deep Creek. The result was
another defeat, this time by the 14th Illinois Cavalry
under Maj. Francis Davidson.</p>



<p>Thomas and his Legion did not win mighty military
victories for the Confederacy; Governor Vance
even accused Thomas’ command of being “a favorite
resort for deserters.” But it appears that this
strange little mountain force did act as a deterrent
against wholesale raids in the Smokies by Federal
sympathizers, and to some extent, raids by marauding
bushwhackers. As for “Little Will” himself, mental
disorder in later years brought him his own
personal civil war and its losing battles. He died in a
North Carolina hospital.</p>

<p>An equally well-known force in the Great Smokies
during the war was a band of Union raiders led by
Col. George W. Kirk. One contemporary called him
“Kirk of Laurel,” referring to a remote watershed in
Madison County where the colonel often camped.
Kirk’s most effective march into the Smokies came
near the close of the war, in the early spring of 1865.
With 400 cavalry and 200 infantry he entered the
mountains through East Tennessee’s Cocke County,
via Mt. Sterling, and marched into Cataloochee.
Turning aside a Confederate company there, he went
on to Waynesville, then proceeded to Soco Valley
and back across the Smokies.</p>

<p>Kirk raided, released Federal prisoners, skirmished
with home guards, and scattered general fear
throughout the mountains. In fact, his main achievement
for his cause lay in diverting Confederate
troops and keeping them scattered on the home
front rather than mobilized on the battlefields where
they were desperately needed. Try as they might, the
Confederates could not find enough of the “silver-greys”
or the “seed-corn”—as those too old and too
young for regular service were called—to totally
protect their homeland from Kirk’s men, or from
renegade bushwhackers who had no cause but plunder
and pillage.</p>

<p>As the Civil War drew toward its final convulsion,
the mountain area engaged in a more familiar struggle
for survival. Food was scarce, soda and salt almost
non-existent. Women leached lye from wood
ashes and made soda. There was no substitute for
salt; when available, it cost a precious dollar a pound.
Bitter enmities divided families, communities, and
counties. Life had never been easy in the mountains;
now it was rigorously difficult. And the people in this
land of “make do or do without” learned new ways
to make do. Continuing old habits and traditions up
their isolated coves and along their steep hillsides,
they created a life that was distinctive, rugged, and
adapted to its natural surroundings.</p>

<p>One historian, John Preston Arthur, has described
the mountain woman’s day as follows:</p>

<p>“<i>Long before the pallid dawn came sifting in through
chink and window they were up and about. As there
were no matches in those days, the housewife
‘unkivered’ the coals which had been smothered in
ashes the night before to be kept ‘alive’ till morning,
and with ‘kindling’ in one hand and a live coal held
on the tines of a steel fork or between iron tongs in
the other, she blew and blew and blew till the splinters
caught fire. Then the fire was started and the
water brought from the spring, poured into the
‘kittle,’ and while it was heating the chickens were
fed, and cows milked, the children dressed, the bread
made, the bacon fried and then coffee was made and
breakfast was ready. That over and the dishes
washed and put away, the spinning wheel, the loom
or the reel were the next to have attention, meanwhile
keeping a sharp lookout for the children,
hawks, keeping the chickens out of the garden,
sweeping the floor, making the beds, churning,
sewing, darning, washing, ironing, taking up the
ashes, and making lye, watching for the bees to
swarm, keeping the cat out the milk pans, dosing the
sick children, tying up the hurt fingers and toes,
kissing the sore place well again, making soap, robbing
the bee hives, stringing beans for winter use,
working the garden, planting and tending a few hardy
flowers in the front yard, such as princess feather,
pansies, sweet-Williams, dahlias, morning glories;
getting dinner, darning, patching, mending, milking
again, reading the Bible, prayers, and so on from
morning till night; and then all over again the next day.</i>”</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>


<p>Emergencies of health and sickness affected the
daily routines. “Doctor-medicine” might have its
place, but home remedies were considered most
reliable—and available. A doctor with his saddlebag
of pills and tonics might be a day’s ride or more away
from the patient. But nature’s medicine chest lay
almost at the doorstep. Plants in swamp and meadow,
leaves and bark and roots of the forest: all healed
many ailments. From ancient Cherokee wisdom and
through their own observations and testing, mountain
people learned the uses of boneset, black
cohosh, wild cherry, mullein, catnip, balm of gilead,
Solomons-seal, sassafras, and dozens of other herbs
and plants.</p>

<p>While they found one school and laboratory in the
woods and hills around them, the people of the
Great Smoky Mountains also worked to provide
themselves with more orthodox classrooms. Continuing
customs that had begun before the War, the
residents of many little communities “made-up” a
school. This meant that they banded together, and
each contributed to a small fund to pay a teacher’s
salary for the year. The “year” was usually three
months. John Preston Arthur left a vivid memoir of
his experience in one of these so-called “old-field”
schools, which were located on land no longer under
cultivation:</p>

<p>“<i>In lieu of kindergarten, graded and normal schools
was the Old-Field school, of which there were generally
only one or two in a county, and they were in
session only when it was not ‘croptime.’ They were
attended by little and big, old and young, sometimes
by as many as a hundred, and all jammed into one
room—a log cabin with a fireplace at each end—puncheon
floor, slab benches, and no windows, except
an opening made in the wall by cutting out a
section of one of the logs, here and there. The pedagogue
in charge (and no matter how large the school
there was but one) prided himself upon his knowledge
of and efficiency in teaching the three R’s—readin’,
’ritin’ and ’rithmetic—and upon his ability to
use effectively the rod, of which a good supply was
always kept in stock. He must know, too, how to
make a quill pen from the wing-feather of a goose or
a turkey, steel and gold pens not having come into
general use. The ink used was made from ‘ink-balls’—sometimes
from poke-berries—and was kept in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
little slim vials partly filled with cotton. These vials,
not having base enough to stand alone, were suspended
on nails near the writer. The schools were
paid from a public fund, the teacher boarding with
the scholars.</i>”</p>

<p>During the latter 1800s, free schools began to replace
subscription schools. But the quality and methods
of education did not appear to change drastically.
Across the Smokies, in East Tennessee’s Big Greenbrier
Cove, Granny’s College provided the rudiments
of public education for many students and was an
example of similar schools in the Great Smokies
region. Lillie Whaley Ownby remembered the house
which was turned into a school:</p>

<p>“<i>Granny College was built before the Civil War by
Humphry John Ownby. This house was two big log
houses, joined together by a huge rock chimney and
a porch across both rooms on both sides of the
house. The houses were built of big poplar logs. The
rooms were 18&#215;20 feet and both rooms had two
doors and two windows. The floor was rough, hewn
logs. There was a huge fireplace in it. The living
room had a partition just behind the doors and a
cellar about 8&#215;10 feet.</i>”</p>

<p>After Mrs. Ownby’s father had acquired the old
log building, he went to Sevierville, the county seat,
and proposed to the school superintendent that he
would furnish this house if the county would supply
a teacher for Big Greenbrier children. This was
agreeable, and Granny’s College, as it was locally
known, came into being.</p>

<p>“<i>The men made benches, long enough for three or
four to sit on. The back was nailed up on some
blocks and the children used the wall for a back rest.
There was no place for books except on the benches
or floor. Dad furnished wood for the fire. The boys
carried it in and kept the fire going. Everyone helped
in keeping the house clean and keeping water in the
house.</i>”</p>

<p>Church as well as school was a personalized part
of family and community life in a way not known in
more formal, urban situations. Each fulfilled not
only its own specific function, spiritual or intellectual,
but also satisfied social needs. The doctrine was
strictly fundamentalist; the dominant denominations
were Baptist and Methodist, although the Presbyterian
influence was also present, especially in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
schools that were founded with both money and
teachers drawn from other regions of the country.</p>

<p>Each summer, Methodist camp meetings brought
families together under the long brush arbors for
weeks of sociable conversation and soulful conversion.
The visiting ministers’ feast of oratory was
matched only by the feast of victuals prepared by
housewives over the campfires as they cooked and
exchanged family news, quilt patterns, recipes, and
“cuttings” from favorite flowers and shrubs.</p>

<p>Baptists were the most numerous denomination.
They divided themselves into many categories,
among others the Primitives, the Freewills, the Missionaries,
and one small group called the Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit.
Their rules were strict: no violins in
church, no dancing anywhere. To be “churched,” or
turned out of the congregation, was heavy punishment—and
not infrequent.</p>

<p>One aspect of church that incorporated an important
feature of mountain life was its singing. In
ancient Ireland and Wales songsters had been accompanied
on the harp. Settlers had brought the Old
Harp song book of early hymns and anthems with
them from the British Isles, and on down the valleys
and across the mountains into these remote byways.
The notes of this music were not round but shaped,
and shape, rather than placement on a staff, indicated
the note. This method simplified reading the
music; and as the unaccompanied, usually untrained,
singers took their pitch from a leader, they proceeded
in beautiful harmony, usually in a minor key.</p>

<p>The mournful sound of minor chords was also
familiar in the ballads common throughout the hills.
Death and unrequited love were their recurring
themes, whether they reached back to England and
the Scottish borders, as in “Lord Thomas and Fair
Elender,” or recounted some local contemporary
affair. Beside their blazing hearths during long, lonely
winter evenings, or at jolly gatherings or through
lazy summer Saturday afternoons, mountain people
remembered the past and recorded the present as
they sang, altering and adding to the ballads which
had been taught to them and which in turn would be
handed on to another generation.</p>

<p>And among those visitors who would begin to
search the mountains during the approaching 20th
century, the folk song collectors and the ballad seekers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
could find here a repository of rare, pure music—much
of it now forgotten even in its own homeland.
The visitors would find a way of life that might seem
static but which was, indeed, changing. For the early
pioneers had yielded to the authentic mountaineer.
His log cabin was being replaced by sash-sawn lumber
in a frame house. Extensive apple orchards and
corn crops yielded the basic ingredients not only for
fruit and bread but for the luxuries of a brandy and
whisky known also as moonshine, white lightning,
Old Tanglefoot.</p>

<p>Hunting and fishing, which had been necessities
for the first settlers, eventually turned into sport as
well. Buffalo, elk, wolves, beavers, passenger pigeons,
and a variety of other game disappeared early
and forever, leaving only the memory of their presence
in names like Buffalo Creek, Elk Mountain,
Wolf Creek, Beaverdam Valley, Pigeon River. But
deer, black bear, fox, raccoon and other animals
remained to challenge the mountain man and his
dogs. The relationship between a hunter and his
hounds was something special. A dog shot or stolen
could be cause for a lifelong feud. Names of individual
dogs—Old Blue, Tige, Big Red—were cherished
by their owners, as were certain breeds. The Plott
dogs, named after the bear hunters who bred them in
Haywood County’s Balsam range, were famous for
their tenacity and strength in hunting bear.</p>

<p>One of the sharpest condemnations that could be
laid on a mountain man concerned the hunting dogs.
An early resident of Roaring Fork above Gatlinburg
was a “hard, cruel man,” despised by his neighbors
and in turn despising them. He had frightened children
and cut a fellow “till he like to bled to death.”
Finally—and most devastatingly—it was agreed that
“he was the type of fellow that would pizen your
dog.”</p>





<p>Livestock raising was important throughout the
Great Smoky Mountains. Stock laws had not yet
been passed, and rail fences were built to keep cattle,
horses, hogs, or sheep <i>out</i> of gardens, fields, and
yards rather than <i>in</i> pastures, pens, and feedlots.
Animals roamed the fields and woods. Hogs fattened
themselves on the mast of nuts and roots from the
great chestnut, oak, and hickory forests; cattle
grazed on the grassy balds in summertime. By mid-May,
farmers in the coves and valleys had driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
their cattle into the high places of the Smokies. Once
every three weeks or so thereafter, they returned to
salt and “gentle” them, thus keeping them familiar
with their owners. In October, before the first
snowfall, the cattle were rounded up. If the season
had been good, livestock drives to near or distant
markets began.</p>

<p><i>Salt licks are among the few
remaining pieces of evidence
of the great herding activity
that once flourished in the
Smokies. Notches were cut
into logs or chiseled into
rocks so the salt wouldn’t be
wasted as it would be if placed
on the ground. The salt
was good for the cattle, and
the regularity of the procedure
helped to keep them
from becoming completely
wild.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>During both the roundup and the drive, livestock
marks played a critical role of identification. These
were devised by each farmer—and acknowledged by
his neighbors—as the “brand” signifying ownership.
These might be various “crops,” “knicks,” and
“notches:” an “underbit” (a crop out of the under
part of the ear), or a “topbit” or a “swallow-fork” cut
in the skin below the neck, or a combination of them
all. If several kinds of animals were included on a
livestock drive, there was a settled rule of procedure.
Cattle led the way, followed by sheep, then hogs,
and finally turkeys, which were usually the first to
start peering toward the sky and searching for the
night’s resting place.</p>

<p>All of these plodding, grunting, gobbling creatures
were kept in order with the help of one or two good
dogs. If a hunter’s dogs were valuable, a livestock
drover’s dogs were invaluable. “Head’em,” the drover
called, and his dogs brought recalcitrant animals
into line, nipping the slow to hurry and curious to
remain orderly.</p>

<p>During a long day’s drive to the county seat, or a
several weeks’ journey to the lowlands of the Carolinas
or Georgia, men and beasts surged forward in a
turmoil of shouting and noise, dust and mud,
autumn’s lingering heat and sudden chills. But on
these journeys, the men left their small mountain
enclaves for a brief glimpse of the larger world. They
returned home not only with bolts of cloth and winter
supplies of salt and coffee, but also with news and
fresh experiences.</p>

<p>And accounts of these experiences were related in
a language that was part of the mountaineer’s unique
heritage. That language revealed a great deal about
the people; it was strong and flexible, old yet capable
of change, sometimes judged “ungrammatical”
but often touched with poetry. In a later century,
students and collectors would come here seeking the
Elizabethan words, the rhythmic cadences of this
speech. It harkened back to a distant homeland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The mountain person’s “afeard” for afraid, or
“poke” for paper bag, were familiar to Shakespeare.
In Chaucer could be found the mountaineer’s use of
“holpt” for helped, and such plurals as “nestes” and
“waspes.” Webster confirmed that “hit” was Saxon
for it, and the primary meaning of “plague” was
anything troublesome or vexatious (the mountain
man might well say someone was plaguing him). The
habit of turning a noun into a verb often added
strength to an otherwise dull sentence: “My farm
will grow enough corn to bread us through the
winter,” or, when speaking of the heavy shoes that
were brogans, “Those hunters just brogued it through
the rough places.”</p>

<p>The daily poetry and humor of the mountain language
was caught in the names of places—Pretty
Hollow Gap, Charlie’s Bunion, Fittified Spring, Miry
Ridge, Bone Valley—and in descriptive words like
“hells” and “slicks” for the tangled laurel and rhododendron
thickets. It was present in the familiar names
of plants: “hearts-a-bustin’-with-love,” “dog-hobble,”
“farewell summer.” And the patterns of their quilts,
pieced with artistic patience and skill, bore names
such as “tree of life,” “Bonaparte’s March,” and
“double wedding ring.”</p>

<p>Thus, the mountain people adapted their language,
as they had their lives, to the needs and beauty of
this land they called home. And contrary to what
might seem the case, these later residents were a
more nearly distinctive group than that which had
first come. The pioneers had been a fairly heterogeneous
group, but as the years passed, those with
itching feet and yearning minds moved on to other
frontiers. Restless children wandered west in search
of instant gold and eternal youth. In time, those
remaining behind became a more and more cohesive
group, sharing a particular challenge, history,
folklore, economy, dream. Their lives were gradually
improving. They had earned the privilege and
joy of calling this their homeland.</p>

<p>Like Homer’s Penelope, like
the Biblical spinners and
weavers, like their sisters at
the wheel and loom in many
times and places, women of
the Great Smokies simultaneously
fulfilled the need for
sturdy cloth and a need for
creating esthetic designs and
pleasing patterns. Frances
Goodrich, who spent four
decades helping to preserve
and honor the region’s handicrafts,
wrote:</p>

<p>“Hardly any other subject
arouses so much enthusiasm
and interest in a circle of
mountain women as does the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
subject of weaving and its kindred
arts. This is true whether
the participants in the talk are
themselves weavers or only
their kinsfolk. Such work has
for generations taken the
place of all other artistic
expression, and everyone, at
least in the days of which I
am telling, knew something
by experience or by watching
the work or by hearsay and
tradition, of this fine craft.</p>

<p>... In the younger women
who were learning to weave
and keeping at it, I could see
the growth of character. A
slack twisted person cannot
make a success as a weaver
of coverlets. Patience and
perseverance are of the first
necessity, and the exercise of
these strengthen the fibers of
the soul.... One who has had
to do with hundreds of mountain
girls ... has told me that
never did she find one to be
of weak and flabby character
whose mother was a weaver:
there was always something
in the child to build on.”</p>

<p>Turning animal and vegetable
fibers into cloth necessitated
several steps. The fibers
had to be washed and then
carded, or straightened, with
wire-toothed implements.
Then the women combed
the carded fibers and rolled
them onto a rod called a
distaff, hence the distaff side
of the family. In the next
step, Aunt Rhodie Abbott
(<a href="#i094_2">below</a>) stretches, twists, and
winds the fibers with a spinning
wheel in Cades Cove.</p>

<p>The women then dyed some
of the yarn. In the last step,
Becky Oakley (<a href="#i094_1">left</a>) weaves
the yarn into cloth on a loom.
Then the women had to turn
the cloth into clothes and
other things.</p>

</div>


<p>A people and their style of life do not change drastically
in one year or two years or three. The year
1900, then, does not define a time when thousands
living in the Great Smokies suddenly abandoned
their 19th-century ways and traditions and bounded
into the modern world. Real transition would come
only with the upheavals of the succeeding decades,
only as a result of America’s industrialization and
two world wars and the arrival of a national park.
Yet the beginning of a new century did inject one
major new element into the lifestream of the Great
Smoky Mountains: the lumber companies and their
money.</p>

<p>The people who lived here had logged before. A
man might operate a family enterprise along some
hillside or in a low-lying cove, using a few strong-armed
relatives or neighbors to help cut and move
the choicest timber of the forest. Andy Huff, for
example, established a small sawmill in Greenbrier
Cove in 1898. Leander Whaley had cut yellow-poplar,
buckeye, and linden from the upper cove—along
Ramsey Prong—during the 1880s. These and a
few other individual loggers felled the largest and
most accessible of ultra-valuable woods such as
cherry, ash, walnut, hickory, and the giant yellow-poplar,
or “tulip tree.” They used steady, slow-plodding
oxen to drag the heavy logs to mill, then
hauled the lumber to markets and railroads in stout-bedded
wagons drawn by four mules, double-teamed.</p>

<p>But the virgin timber soon attracted a wider
attention. In 1901, a report on the Southern Appalachians
from President Theodore Roosevelt to Congress
concluded simply that “These are the heaviest
and most beautiful hardwood forests of the continent.”
Of the Great Smokies in particular, the report
noted that besides the hardwoods the forest contained
“the finest and largest bodies of spruce in the
Southern Appalachians.” Lumber entrepreneurs
were equally impressed. In that same year, three
partners paid about $9.70 per hectare for the 34,400-hectare
($3/85,000-acre) bulk of the Little River watershed.
Some 20 years later, Col. W. B. Townsend
moved from Pennsylvania and took control of Little
River Lumber Company.</p>

<p>On the North Carolina slopes of the Smokies,
companies purchased land in swaths stretching from
ridge to ridge, staking off watersheds like so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
claims. In 1903, W. M. Ritter Lumber Company set
up its operations along Hazel Creek. A year later,
Montvale Lumber Company moved into the adjacent
Eagle Creek area. To the west of Montvale
would, in time, lie the Kitchin mill and its Twentymile
Creek domain; to the east of Ritter, Norwood Lumber
Company embraced the reaches of Forney
Creek. And looming beside and above them all stood
the 36,400 timbered hectares (90,000 acres) of the
Champion Coated Paper Company, an area that included
Deep Creek and Greenbrier Cove and the
headwaters of the Oconaluftee River.</p>

<p>The companies needed men to cut the trees, skid
the logs, work the animals, saw the lumber, lay the
roads. They called upon the mountaineers who still
owned small tracts in Cades Cove and Cataloochee
and lower Greenbrier and throughout the Smokies;
or they allowed some workers who had sold forested
land to stay in their homes, though now on company
property; or they brought in hired hands from outside
and housed them and their families in dormitory-like
buildings and readymade “towns.” These
mushrooming mill villages—Elkmont on the Little
River, Crestmont on Big Creek, Proctor on Hazel
Creek, Ravensford and Smokemont and Fontana—provided
a booming cash market for homegrown
food and, as soon as the money changed hands,
imported products.</p>

<p>More often than not, residents of the Great Smoky
Mountains drove to and from market in covered
wagons that protected their goods. Because the drive
to an outside market such as Waynesville, Newport,
or Maryville might take two or even three days, local
families sold what they could to the loggers and
sawmill men. They set up honey and apple stands
along the roads and offered grapes in season. They
supplied stores with butter and eggs. Children could
trade in one egg for a week’s supply of candy or
firecrackers.</p>

<p>A businesslike atmosphere filtered through the
quiet of the Smokies. Though wolves and panthers
had largely disappeared by 1910, fur buyers and
community traders enjoyed a brisk exchange in
mink, raccoon, fox, and ’possum hides. Oak bark
and chestnut wood, called “tanbark” and “acid
wood” because they were sources of valuable tannic
acid, brought $7 per cord when shipped to Asheville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
or Knoxville. As the sawmills flourished, makeshift
box houses of vertical poplar and chestnut planks
gave way to more substantial weatherboarded homes
of horizontal lengths and tight-fitting frames. Slick,
fancy, buggy-riding “drummers” peddled high-button
shoes and off-color stories. The spacious Wonderland
Park Hotel and the Appalachian Club at Elkmont,
and a hunting lodge on Jake’s Creek graced the once
forbidding mountainsides.</p>

<p>Undergirding this development was a growing cash
base: peaches and chestnuts, pork and venison, wax
and lard—translated into money—brought flour and
sugar, yarn and needles, tools and ammunition. Yet
in the midst of this new-found activity, many clung
to their old habits. Children still found playtime fun
by sliding down hills of pine needles and “riding”
poplar saplings from treetop to treetop. Hard-shell
Baptist preachers, such as the hunter and “wilderness
saddle-bagger” known as “Preacher John” Stinnett,
still devoted long spare hours, and sometimes workdays
as well, to reading The Book: “I just toted my
Bible in a tow sack at the handle of my bull tongue
and I studied it at the turn of the furrow and considered
it through the rows.”</p>

<p>But whatever the immediate considerations of the
hour happened to be, logging was the order of the
day. From the Big Pigeon River, all the way to the
Little Tennessee, the second generation of timber-cutters
had moved into the Smokies on a grand
scale.</p>

<p>The companies, with their manpower, their strategically
placed sawmills, and their sophisticated
equipment, produced board feet of lumber by the
millions. The rest of the country, with its increased
demands for paper and residential construction, absorbed
these millions and cried for more. By 1909,
when production attained its peak in the Smokies
and throughout the Appalachians, logging techniques
had reached such an advanced state that even remote
stands of spruce and hemlock could be worked
with relative ease. Demand continued unabated and
even received a slight boost when World War I broke
out in 1914.</p>

<p><i>Pages 100-101: Sawmills, such

<p>High volume covered high costs. The Little River
Lumber Company, perhaps the most elaborate logging
operation in the Smokies, cut a total of two
billion board feet. Cherry, the most valuable of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
woods, with its exquisite grain and rich color, was
also the scarcest. Yellow-poplar, that tall, straight
tree with a buoyancy that allowed it to float high,
turned out to be the most profitable of all saw timber.
Coniferous forests, the thick, dark regions of pungent
spruce and hemlock, yielded a portion of the
company’s output.</p>

<p>Extraction of such proportions was not easy. Timber
cruisers combed the forests, estimating board
feet and ax-marking suitable trees. Three-man saw
teams followed the cruisers. One, the “chipper,” calculated
the fall of the tree and cut a “lead” in the
appropriate side. Two sawyers then took over,
straining back and forth upon their crosscut saw
until gravity and the immense weight of the tree
finished their job for them. The work was hard and
hazardous. Sometimes, if the lead were not cut
properly, the trunk would fall toward the men; sudden
death or permanent injury might result from the
kickback of a doomed tree’s final crash, or from a
moment’s carelessness.</p>

<p>To remove the felled timber, larger companies
laid railroad tracks far up the creeks from their mills.
At the eastern edge of the Smokies, for instance, one
such terminus grew into the village of Crestmont,
which boasted a hotel, two movie theaters, and a
well-stocked commissary. Such accommodations
seemed a distant cry indeed from the upper branches
of Big Creek, gathering its waters along the slopes of
Mt. Sterling, Mt. Cammerer, and Mt. Guyot.
Workers from improbable distances—even countries
“across the waters,” such as Italy—teamed with the
mountain people to push a standard gauge track
alongside the boulder-strewn streams. Bolted onto
oaken ties that were spaced far enough apart to
discourage foot travel, the black rails drove ahead,
switched back to higher ground, crossed Big Creek a
dozen times before they reached the flat way station
of Walnut Bottoms.</p>

<p><i>Massive steam-powered skidders
pulled logs in off the
hills to a central pile. Then
the loaders took over and
put the logs on trains, which
carried them to the mills.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dominated by powerful, blunt-bodied locomotives,
the railroads gave rise to stories that were a flavorful
blend of pathos and danger. “Daddy” Bryson and a
fireman named Forrester were killed on a sharp
curve along Jake’s Creek of Little River. Although
Forrester jumped clear when the brakes failed to
hold, he was buried under an avalanche of deadly,
cascading logs. There were moments of comedy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
well as tragedy. In the same river basin, Colonel
Townsend asked engineer Noah Bunyan Whitehead
one day when he was going to stop putting up all that
black smoke from his train. Bun answered: “When
they start making white coal.”</p>

<p>Railroads could reach only so far, however. The
most complex phase of the logging process was
“skidding,” or bringing the felled logs from inaccessible
distances to the waiting cars. As the first step,
men armed with cant hooks or short, harpoon-like
peavies, simply rolled the logs down the mountainsides.
Such continuous “ball-hooting,” as it was
called, gouged paths which rain and snow etched
deeper into scars of heavy erosion. Sometimes oxen
and mules pulled, or “snaked,” the timber through
rough terrain to its flatcar destination. Horses soon
replaced the slower animals and proved especially
adept at “jayhooking,” or dragging logs down steep
slopes by means of J-hooks and grabs. When the logs
gained speed and threatened to overtake them, the
men and nimble-footed horses simply stepped onto a
spur trail; the open link slipped off at the J-hook and
the logs slid on down the slope under their own
momentum.</p>

<p>Even more ingenious skidding methods were
devised. Splash-dams of vertical hemlock boards created
reservoirs on otherwise shallow, narrow streams.
The released reservoir, when combined with heavy
rains, could carry a large amount of timber far
downstream. In the mill pond, loggers with hobnailed
boots kept the logs moving and uncorked occasional
jams. Another method devised to move virgin timber
down steep slopes was the trestled flume. The large,
wooden graded flumes provided a rapid but expensive
mode of delivery. One carried spruce off
Clingmans Dome.</p>

<p>There were, finally, the loader and skidders. The
railroad-mounted steam loader was nicknamed the
“Sarah Parker” after “a lady who must have been
real strong.” The skidder’s revolving drum pulled in
logs by spectacular overhead cables. Loaded with
massive timber lengths, these cables spanned valleys
and retrieved logs from the very mountaintops.</p>

<p><i>The great scale of the logging
machinery was like nothing
the Smokies had seen
before. Long trains carried
loads of huge tree trunks to
sawmills after the flat cars
were loaded by railroad-mounted
cranes.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>To coordinate all of these operations efficiently
required skill and judgment. The lumber companies
devised numerous approaches to the problem of
maximum production at lowest cost. They contracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
with individuals; Andy Huff, for example,
continued to run a mill at the mouth of Roaring Fork
and paid his men a full 75 cents for a 16-hour day.
The corporations sometimes worked together; in
one maneuver, Little River helped Champion flume
its spruce pulpwood to the Little River railroad for
shipment to Champion’s paper mill at Canton, North
Carolina. Haste and carelessness could lead to shocking
waste. When one company moved its operations
during World War I, 1.5 million board feet of newly
cut timber was left to rot at the head of Big Creek.</p>

<p>The ravages of logging led to fires. Although fires
were sometimes set on purpose to kill snakes and
insects and to burn underbrush, abnormal conditions
invited abnormal mishaps. Parched soil no
longer held in place by a web of living roots, dry tops
of trees piled where they had been flung after trimming
the logs, and flaming sparks of locomotives or
skidders: any combination of these caused more than
20 disastrous fires in the Smokies during the 1920s. A
two-month series of fires devastated parts of
Clingmans Dome, Siler’s Bald, and Mt. Guyot. One
holocaust on Forney Creek, ignited by an engine
spark, raced through the tops of 24-meter (80-foot)
hemlocks and surged over 5 kilometers (3 miles) in
four hours. A site of most intense destruction was in
the Sawtooth range of the Charlie’s Bunion area.</p>

<p>Despite the ravages of fire, erosion, and the voracious
ax and saw, all was not lost. Some two-thirds of
the Great Smoky Mountains was heavily logged or
burned, but pockets of virgin timber remained in a
shrinking number of isolated spots and patches at
the head of Cataloochee, the head of Greenbrier,
and much of Cosby and Deep Creek. And as the
1920s passed into another decade, the vision of saving
what was left of this virgin forest, saving the
land—saving the homeland—grew in the lonely but
insistent conscience of a small number of concerned
and convincing citizens.</p>

<p>Logging dominated the life of the Great Smoky
Mountains during the early decades of the 20th
century. But there was another side to that life.
Apart from the sawmills and the railroads and the
general stores, which were bustling harbingers of
new ways a-coming, the higher forests, the foot trails,
and the moonshine stills remained as tokens of old
ways a-lingering. One person in particular came to
know and speak for this more primitive world.</p>

<p>Horace Kephart was born in 1862 in East Salem,
Pennsylvania. His Swiss ancestors were pioneers of
the Pennsylvania frontier. During his childhood,
Kephart’s family moved to the Iowa prairie, where
his mother gave him a copy of the novel <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> by Daniel Defoe. In the absence of playmates
on the vast Midwest grassland, young Kephart
dreamed and invented his own games, fashioned his
own play swords and pistols out of wood and even
built a cave out of prairie sod and filled it with
“booty” collected off the surrounding countryside.</p>

<p>Horace Kephart never forgot his frontier beginnings.
He saved his copy of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and
added others: <i>The Wild Foods of Great Britain</i>, <i>The
Secrets of Polar Travel</i>, Theodore Roosevelt’s <i>The
Winning of the West</i>. Camping and outdoor cooking,
ballistics and photography captured his attention and
careful study.</p>

<p>Kephart polished his education with periods of
learning and library work at Boston University,
Cornell, and Yale. In 1887 he married a girl from
Ithaca, New York, and began to raise a family. By
1890, he was librarian of the well-known St. Louis
Mercantile Library. In his late thirties, Kephart grew
into a quiet, intense loner, a shy and reticent man
with dark, piercing eyes. He remained an explorer at
heart, a pioneer, an individual secretly nurturing the
hope of further adventures.</p>

<p>Opportunity arrived in a strange disguise. Horace
Kephart’s largely unfulfilled visions of escape were
combined with increasingly prolonged periods of
drinking. Experience with a tornado in the streets of
St. Louis affected his nerves. As he later recalled:</p>

<p>“... <i>then came catastrophe; my health broke down.
In the summer of 1904, finding that I must abandon
professional work and city life, I came to western
North Carolina, looking for a big primitive forest
where I could build up strength anew and indulge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
my lifelong fondness for hunting, fishing and exploring
new ground.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Horace Kephart, librarian-turned-mountaineer,
won the
hearts of the Smokies people
with his quiet and unassuming
ways. He played a major
role in the initial movement
for a national park.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>He chose the Great Smokies almost by accident.
Using maps and a compass while he rested at his
father’s home in Dayton, Ohio, he located the nearest
wilderness and then determined the most remote
corner of that wilderness. After his recuperation he
traveled to Asheville, North Carolina, where he took
a railroad line that wound through a honeycomb of
hills to the small way station of Dillsboro. And from
there, at the age of 42, he struck out, with a gun and
a fishing rod and three days’ rations, for the virgin
mountainside forest. After camping for a time on
Dick’s Creek, his eventual wild destination turned
out to be a deserted log cabin on the Little Fork of
the Sugar Fork of Hazel Creek.</p>

<p>His nearest neighbors lived 3 kilometers (2 miles)
away, in the equally isolated settlement of Medlin.
Medlin consisted of a post office, a corn mill, two
stores, four dwellings, and a nearby schoolhouse that
doubled as a church. The 42 households that officially
collected their mail at the Medlin Post Office
inhabited an area of 42 square kilometers (16 square
miles). It was, as Kephart describes it:</p>

<p>“... <i>the forest primeval, where roamed some sparse
herds of cattle, razorback hogs and the wild beasts.
Speckled trout were in all the streams. Bears sometimes
raided the fields and wildcats were a common
nuisance. Our settlement was a mere slash in the vast
woodland that encompassed it.</i>”</p>

<p>But it was also, for Horace Kephart, a new and
invigorating home. He loved it. He thrived in it. At
first he concentrated his senses on the natural beauty
around him, on the purple rhododendron, the flame
azalea, the fringed orchis, the crystal clear streams.
Yet as the months passed, he found that he could not
overlook the people.</p>

<p>The mountain people were as solidly a part of the
Smokies as the boulders themselves. These residents
of branch and cove, of Medlin and Proctor and all
the other tiny settlements tucked high along the
slanting creekbeds of the Great Smoky Mountains,
these distinctive “back of beyond” hillside farmers
and work-worn wives and wary moonshine distillers
lodged in Kephart’s consciousness and imagination
with rock-like strength and endurance.</p>

<p>Initially silent and suspicious of this stranger in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
their midst, families gradually came to accept him.
They approved of his quietness and his even-handed
ways, even confiding in him with a simple eloquence.
One foot-weary distiller, after leading Kephart over
kilometers of rugged terrain, concluded: “Everywhere
you go, it’s climb, scramble, clamber down,
and climb again. You cain’t go nowheres in this
country without climbin’ both ways.” The head of a
large family embracing children who spilled forth
from every corner of the cabin confessed: “We’re so
poor, if free silver was shipped in by the carload we
couldn’t pay the freight.”</p>

<p>Kephart came to respect and to wonder at these
neighbors who combined a lack of formal education
with a fullness of informal ability. Like him, many of
their personal characters blended a weakness for
liquor with a strong sense of individual etiquette. He
heard, for example, the story of an overnight visitor
who laid his loaded gun under his pillow; when he
awoke the next morning, the pistol was where he had
left it, but the cartridges stood in a row on a nearby
table.</p>

<p>He met one George Brooks of Medlin: farmer,
teamster, storekeeper, veterinarian, magistrate,
dentist. While Brooks did own a set of toothpullers
and wielded them mercilessly, some individuals practiced
the painful art of tooth-jumping to achieve the
same result. Uncle Neddy Carter even tried to jump
one of his own teeth; he cut around the gum, wedged
a nail in, and made ready to strike the nail with a
hammer, but he missed the nail and mashed his nose
instead.</p>

<p>None of these fascinating tales escaped the attention
of Horace Kephart. As he regained his health,
the sustained energy of his probing mind also
returned. Keeping a detailed journal of his experiences,
he drove himself as he had done in the past.
He developed almost an obsession to record all that
he learned, to know this place and people completely,
to stop time for an interval and capture this mountain
way of life in his mind and memory. For three
years he lived by the side of Hazel Creek. Though he
later moved down to Bryson City during the winters,
he spent most of his summers 13 kilometers (8 miles)
up Deep Creek at an old cabin that marked the
original Bryson Place.</p>

<p>Kephart distilled much of what he learned into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
series of books. <i>The Book of Camping and
Woodcraft</i> appeared in 1906 as one of the first detailed
guidebooks to woodsmanship, first aid, and
the art we now call “backpacking,” all based on his
personal experience and knowledge. There is even a
chapter on tanning pelts. But the most authoritative
book concerned the people themselves. <i>Our Southern
Highlanders</i>, published in 1913 and revised nine
years later, faithfully retraces Kephart’s life among
the Appalachian mountain folk after he “left the
tame West and came into this wild East.” And paramount
among the wilds of the East was the alluring
saga of the moonshiner.</p>

</div>

</figure>


<p>In Horace Kephart’s own eyes, his greatest education
came from the spirited breed of mountain man
known as “blockade runners” or simply “blockaders.”
These descendants of hard-drinking Scotsmen and
Irishmen had always liked to “still” a little corn
whisky to drink and, on occasion, to sell. But as the
1920s opened into the era of Prohibition, the mountain
distiller of a now contraband product reached
his heyday. He found and began to supply an
expanding, and increasingly thirsty market.</p>

<p>Stealth became the keynote in this flourishing
industry. Mountaineers searched out laurel-strangled
hollows and streams that seemed remote even to
their keen eyes. There they assembled the copper
stills into which they poured a fermented concoction
of cornmeal, rye, and yeast known as “sour mash” or
“beer.” By twice heating the beer and condensing its
vapors through a water-cooled “worm” or spiral tube,
they could approximate the uncolored liquor enjoyed
at the finest New York parties. And by
defending themselves with shotguns rather than with
words, they could continue their approximations.</p>

<p>In this uniquely romantic business, colorful characters
abounded on both sides of the law. Horace
Kephart wrote about a particular pair of men who
represented the two legal extremes: the famous
moonshiner Aquilla Rose, and the equally resilient
revenuer from the Internal Revenue Service, W. W.
Thomason.</p>

<p>Aquilla, or “Quill,” Rose lived for 25 years at the
head of sparsely populated Eagle Creek. After killing
a man in self-defense and hiding out in Texas
awhile, Rose returned to the Smokies with his wife
and settled so far up Eagle Creek that he crowded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the Tennessee-North Carolina state line. Quill made
whisky by the barrel and seemed to drink it the same
way, although he was occasionally seen playing his
fiddle or sitting on the porch with his long beard
flowing and his Winchester resting across his lap. His
eleventh Commandment, to “never get ketched,”
was faithfully observed, and Quill Rose remained
one of the few mountain blockaders to successfully
combine a peaceable existence at home with a dangerous
livelihood up the creek.</p>

<p>W.W. Thomason visited Horace Kephart at Bryson
City in 1919. Kephart accepted this “sturdy, dark-eyed
stranger” as simply a tourist interested in the
moonshining art. While Thomason professed innocence,
his real purpose in the Smokies was to destroy
stills which settlers were operating on Cherokee
lands to evade the local law. He prepared for the
job by taking three days to carve and paint a lifelike
rattlesnake onto a thick sourwood club. During the
following weeks, he would startle many a moonshiner
by thrusting the stick close and twisting it
closer.</p>

<p>When Kephart led the “Snake-Stick Man” into
whiskyed coves in the Sugarlands or above the
Cherokee reservation, he found himself deputized
and a participant in the ensuing encounters. More
often than not, shots rang out above the secluded
thickets. In one of these shootouts, Thomason’s
hatband, solidly woven out of hundreds of strands of
horsehair, saved this fearless revenuer’s life.</p>

<p>All the wonders of the Great Smoky Mountains—the
nature, the people, the stories, and the battles
and the jests—affected Horace Kephart mightily.
This man whose own life had been “saved” by the
Smokies began to think in terms of repaying this
mountain area in kind. For during his years on Hazel
Creek and Deep Creek and in Bryson City, he saw
the results of the “loggers’ steel,” results that caused
him to lament in a single phrase, “slash, crash, go the
devastating forces.” In 1923 he summarized his feelings
about the lumber industry:</p>

<p><i>When the Civilian Conservation
Corps moved into the
Smokies in the 1930s, young
men from the cities saw
moonshine stills firsthand.
Here one pretends to be a
moonshiner and hangs his
head low for the photographer.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“<i>When I first came into the Smokies the whole region
was one superb forest primeval. I lived for several
years in the heart of it. My sylvan studio spread over
mountain after mountain, seemingly without end,
and it was always clean and fragrant, always vital,
growing new shapes of beauty from day to day. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
vast trees met overhead like cathedral roofs.... Not
long ago I went to that same place again. It was
wrecked, ruined, desecrated, turned into a thousand
rubbish heaps, utterly vile and mean.</i>”</p>


<p>Kephart began to think in terms of a national
park. He and a Japanese photographer friend,
George Masa, trekked the Smokies and gathered
concrete experience and evidence of the mountains’
wild splendor. At every opportunity, Kephart advocated
the park idea in newspapers, in brochures, and
by word of mouth. He proudly acknowledged that “I
owe my life to these mountains and I want them
preserved that others may profit by them as I have.”</p>

<p>The concept of a national park for these southern
mountains was not a new one in 1920. Forty years
earlier, a retired minister and former state geologist,
Drayton Smith, of Franklin, North Carolina, had
proposed “a national park in the mountains.” In
1885, Dr. Henry O. Marcy of Boston, Massachusetts,
had discussed future health resorts in America and
had considered “the advisability of securing under
state control a large reservation of the higher range
as a park.” By the turn of the century, the Appalachian
National Park Association was formed in
Asheville, North Carolina, and publicized the idea of
a national park somewhere in the region, not specifically
the Great Smokies. When the Federal Government
seemed to rule out this possibility, the
Association devoted the bulk of its time and effort to
the creation of national forest reserves.</p>

<p>But people like Horace Kephart knew the difference
between a national park that safeguarded trees
and a national forest that allowed logging. In 1923, a
group supporting a genuine Great Smokies park
formed in Knoxville, Tennessee. Mr. and Mrs. Willis
P. Davis, of the Knoxville Iron Company, in the
summer of that year had enjoyed a trip to some of
the country’s western parks. As they viewed the
wonders preserved therein, Mrs. Davis was reminded
of the natural magnificence near her own home.
“Why can’t we have a national park in the Great
Smokies?” she asked her husband.</p>

<p>Back in Knoxville, Mr. Davis began to ask that
question of friends and associates. One of these was
Col. David C. Chapman, a wholesale druggist, who
listened but did not heed right away:</p>

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Not until I accidentally saw a copy of President
Theodore Roosevelt’s report on the Southern Appalachians
did I have any idea of just what we have
here. In reading and rereading this report I learned
for the first time that the Great Smokies have some
truly superlative qualities. After that I became keenly
interested in Mr. Davis’ plan and realized that a
national park should be a possibility.</i>”</p>

<p>The Davises and Chapman led the formation of
the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association.
Congressmen and Secretary of the Interior
Hubert Work were contacted. Work endorsed the
project, and two years later Congress passed an act
authorizing associations in Tennessee and North Carolina
to buy lands and deed them to the U.S.
Government.</p>

<p>Problems immediately presented themselves. The
citizens would have to buy this park. Unlike
Yellowstone and other previous land grants from the
Federal Government, the Smokies were owned by
many private interests and therefore presented a
giant challenge to hopeful fund raisers. To further
complicate matters, no group had the power to condemn
lands; any property, if secured at all, would
have to be coaxed from its owner at an appropriately
high price. Finally, and most discouragingly, park
enthusiasts faced an area of more than 6,600 separate
tracts and thousands of landowners.</p>

<p>Yet events conspired to give the park movement a
sustaining drive. The lumber companies had made
the people of the Smokies more dependent on money
for additional food, modern-day clothing, and new
forms of recreation. World War I and the coming of
the highways had instilled a restlessness in the mountain
people, a yearning for new sights and different
ways of living. Some began to echo the sentiments of
one farmer who, after realizing meager returns for
his hard labor on rocky fields, looked around him
and concluded, “Well, I reckon a park is about all
this land is fit for.”</p>

<p>Determined leadership overcame obstacles large
and small. Behind Chapman’s professorial appearance—his
wire-rimmed glasses and three-piece suits and
unkempt hair—was a man who had been a colonel in
World War I, a man who had resolved to make the
dream of a national park into a reality. Along with
Chapman as the driving force, associate director of
the National Park Service Arno B. Cammerer provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
the steering and the gears. Cammerer’s marked
enthusiasm for incorporating the Great Smokies into
the national park system added a well-placed,
influential spokesman to the movement. By spring of
1926, groups in North Carolina and Tennessee had
raised more than a million dollars. Within another
year, the legislatures of the two states each had
donated twice that amount.</p>

<p>With $5 million as a nest egg, park advocates
turned to the actual buying of lands. Cammerer himself
defined a boundary which included the most
suitable territory and which, as it turned out,
conformed closely to the final boundary. Chapman
and his associates approached individual homeowners.
Sometimes they received greetings similar
to one on a homemade sign:</p>

<p>“<i>Col. Chapman. You and Hoast are notify. Let the
Cove People Alone. Get Out. Get Gone. 40 m.
Limit.</i>”</p>

<p>The older mountain people clung desperately to
what they had. Even though the buyers were prepared
to issue lifetime leases for those who wanted
to stay, they found it difficult to remove this resolute
band from their homeland.</p>

<p>Many of the Smokies’ residents—the younger,
more mobile, more financially oriented ones—accepted
the coming of the park with a combination
of fatalism and cautious hope. Gradually they acknowledged
the fact that a park and its tourist trade
might be a continuing asset, whereas the prosperity
from logging had proved at best only temporary.
After John D. Rockefeller, Jr., through the Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund, doubled the
park fund with a much-needed gift of an additional
$5 million, renewed offers of cash completely melted
many icy objections.</p>

<p>The lumber companies followed suit, but for
higher stakes. Champion Fibre, Little River, Suncrest,
Norwood, and Ritter were among the 18 timber and
pulpwood companies that owned more than 85 percent
of the proposed park area. They fought to stay
for obvious economic reasons, yet they were prepared
to leave if the price was right. Little River
Lumber Company, after considerable negotiation
with the state of Tennessee and the city of Knoxville,
sold its 30,345 hectares (75,000 acres) for only $8.80
per hectare ($3.57 per acre).</p>

<p>The vast holdings of Champion Fibre Company
were at the very heart of the park, however, and the
results of the company’s resistance to a national park
were central to success or failure of the whole
movement. Champion’s 36,400 hectares (90,000
acres) included upper Greenbrier, Mt. Guyot, Mt.
LeConte, the Chimneys, and a side of Clingmans
Dome, crowned by extensive forests of virgin spruce.
This splendid domain was the cause of hot tempers,
torrid accusations, rigid defenses, and a hard-fought
condemnation lawsuit. In the end, however, on
March 30, 1931, Champion Fibre agreed to sell for a
total of $3 million, a sum which took on added
appeal during the slump of the disastrous Depression.</p>

<p>Four days after this agreement, Horace Kephart
died in an automobile accident near Cherokee, North
Carolina. An 8-ton boulder was later brought from
the hills above Smokemont to mark his grave in
Bryson City.</p>

<p>Only a few years earlier Kephart had said:</p>

<p>“<i>Here to-day is the last stand of primeval American
forest at its best. If saved—and if saved at all it must
be done at once—it will be a joy and a wonder to our
people for all time. The nation is summoned by a
solemn duty to preserve it.</i>”</p>

<p>And it was, indeed, preserved. The Federal Government
in 1933 contributed a final $2 million to the
cause, establishing the figure of $12 million as the
grand total of money raised for the park. On September
2, 1940, with land acquisition almost completed,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park “for the permanent
enjoyment of the people.”</p>

<p>The park movement’s greatest victory, coming as
it did at Kephart’s death, lent a special significance
to his life. For his experience symbolized the good
effects that a national park in the Great Smoky
Mountains could create. These mountains and their
people inspired him to write eloquently of their truth
and endurance; his own health seemed to thrive in
the rugged, elemental environment of the Smokies.
Perhaps most important of all, he discovered here
the impact of what it can mean to know a real home.
Having found a home for himself, he labored tirelessly
for a national park to give to his fellow
countrymen the same opportunity for wonder and
renewal and growth.</p>

</div>


<p>As early as 1930, citizens and officials across the
United States had begun to realize that a new additional
park would indeed encompass and preserve
the Great Smoky Mountains. Hard-working Maj. J.
Ross Eakin, the first superintendent of the park,
arrived at the beginning of the next year from his
previous post in Montana’s Glacier National Park
and was quickly introduced to the cold, mid-January
winds of the Great Smokies and some of the controversies
that had arisen during establishment of the
park.</p>

<p>At first, Eakin and his few assistants limited their
duties to the basics; they marked boundaries, prevented
hunting, fought and forestalled fire. But as
the months passed, as the park grew in size and its
staff increased in number, minds and muscles alike
tackled the real problem of shaping a sanctuary
which all the people of present and future generations
could enjoy.</p>

<p>Help came from an unexpected quarter. The economic
depression that had gripped the country in
1930 tightened its stranglehold as the decade
progressed. In the famous “Hundred Days” spring of
1933, a special session of Congress passed the first
and most sweeping series of President Roosevelt’s
New Deal legislation. The Civilian Conservation
Corps, created in April, established work for more
than two million young men. CCC camps, paying
$30 a month for work in conservation, flood control,
and wilderness projects, sprang up.</p>

<p>As far as the young, struggling Great Smoky
Mountains National Park was concerned, this new
CCC program could not have come at a better time.
Through the Corps, much-needed manpower converged
by the hundreds on the Smokies from such
places as New Jersey, Ohio, and New York City.
Supervised by Park Service officials and reserve officers
from the U.S. Army, college-age men first set up
their own camps—17 in all—and then went about
that old familiar labor in the Smokies, landscaping
and building roads. In addition, they constructed
trails, shelters, powerlines, fire towers, and bridges.</p>

<p>Some of their tent-strewn camps were pitched on
old logging sites with familiar names like Smokemont
and Big Creek. Others, such as Camp No. 413 on
Forney Creek, were more remote but no less
adequate. Ingenuity, sparked by necessity, created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
accommodations which made full use of all available
resources. At Camp Forney, for instance, there was
a barracks, a messhall, a bathhouse, and an officers’
quarters. Water from clear, cold Forney Creek was
piped into the kitchen; food was stored in a homemade
ice chest. The residents of the camp, seeing no
reason why they should rough it more than
necessary, added a library, a post office, and a commissary
in their spare time.</p>

<p>The CCC men, their ages between 18 and 25, did
not forget recreation. As teams organized for
football, baseball, boxing, wrestling, and soccer, the
hills resounded with unfamiliar calls of scores and
umpires’ decisions, while the more familiar tussles of
boxing and wrestling raised echoes of old partisan
matches throughout the hills. At times, these young
workers answered the urge to ramble, too. One of
them later recalled his days as a radio man on the
top of Mt. Sterling:</p>

<p>“<i>It was seven miles steep up there, and sometimes
I’d jog down about sundown and catch a truck for
Newport. That’s where we went to be with people.
The last truck brought us back after midnight.</i>”</p>

<p>A minor problem sometimes arose when the CCC
“outsiders” began dating local girls; farming fathers
sometimes set fires to give the boys something else
to do during the weekends. The conflict of cultures
was thrown into a particularly sharp light when a
Corps participant shot a farmer’s hog one night and
shouted that he had killed a bear!</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the Civilian Conservation
Corps program in the Great Smoky Mountains was a
major success. In one or two extremely rugged areas
of the park, retired loggers were hired in 10-day
shifts to hack out or even drill short trail lengths.
The rest of the 965-kilometer (600-mile) trail system,
together with half a dozen fire towers and almost 480
kilometers (300 miles) of fire roads and tourist
highways, was the product of the CCC. When Superintendent
Eakin evaluated the work of only the first
two years of the CCC’s operation, he equated it with
a decade of normal accomplishment.</p>


<p>Through these and similar efforts, which included
almost 110 kilometers (70 miles) of the famous Appalachian
Trail, the natural value of the Great Smoky
Mountains became a recognized and established lure
for thousands, eventually millions, of visitors. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
there was another resource that remained untapped,
a challenge to the national park purpose and
imagination. This resource was first overlooked, then
neglected, and finally confronted with respect. The
resource was the people and their homes.</p>

<p>Many previous owners of park land had received
lifetime leases that allowed them to live on in their
dwellings, work their fields, and cut dead timber
even while tourists streamed through the Smokies.
Some of the lessees, such as those living near
Gatlinburg, saw a new era coming, thrusting back
the street-ends until motels and restaurants and craft
shops pushed against an abandoned apple orchard
or a 10-plot cemetery or a deserted backyard laced
with lilacs. These rememberers of an earlier time
relinquished their lands in the park, more often than
not resettling within sight of the mountain range and
the homeland they had just left.</p>

<p>Yet a few lessees, those living further up the
valleys, deeper into the mountains, or isolated from
the well-traveled paths, these few folks stayed on.
The Walker sisters of Little Greenbrier Cove were
representative of this small group.</p>

<p>John Walker, their father, was himself the eldest
of his parents’ 15 children. In 1860, at the age of 19,
he became engaged to 14-year-old Margaret Jane
King. The Civil War postponed their wedding, and
John, an ardent Unionist who had enlisted in the
First Tennessee Light Artillery, spent three months
in a Confederate prison and lost 45 kilograms (100
pounds) before he was exchanged and provided with
a pension. In 1866, they were finally married. After
Margaret Jane’s father died, the young couple moved
into the King homestead in Little Greenbrier.</p>

<p>They had eleven children: four boys, seven girls.
John remained a strong Republican and Primitive
Baptist; he liked to boast that in a long and fruitful
lifetime he had spent a total of 50 cents on health
care for his family (two of his sons had once required
medicine for the measles). Margaret Jane was herself
an “herb doctor” and a midwife, talents which complemented
John’s skills as a blacksmith, carpenter,
miller, farmer. Once, as Margaret Jane was chasing a
weasel from her hens, the reddish-brown animal bit
her thumb and held on; she calmly thrust her hand
into a full washtub, where the weasel drowned in
water stained by her blood.</p>

<p>The children grew up. The three older boys married
and moved away. The youngest, Giles Daniel,
left for Iowa and fought in World War I. Sarah
Caroline, the only one of the daughters ever to
marry, began her life with Jim Shelton in 1908. Hettie
Rebecca worked for a year or two in a Knoxville
hosiery mill, but the Depression sent her back home.
When Nancy Melinda died in 1931, the original home
place was left in the hands of five sisters; Hettie,
Margaret Jane, Polly, Louisa Susan, and Martha Ann.</p>

<p>They lived the self-sufficiency of their ancestors.
They stated simply that “our land produces everything
we need except sugar, soda, coffee, and salt.”
Their supplies came from the grape arbor, the
orchard, the herb and vegetable garden; the sheep,
hogs, fowl, and milch cows; the springhouse crocks
of pickled beets and sauerkraut; the dried food and
the seed bags and the spice racks that hung from
nails hammered into the newspaper-covered walls of
the main house. The material aspects of their surroundings
represented fully the fabric of life as it had
been known in the hundreds of abandoned cabins
and barns and outbuildings that dotted the landscape
of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
And the Walker sisters were not about to give up
their way of life without a struggle. In a poem, “My
Mountain Home,” Louisa expressed the family’s
feelings:</p>

<p>In January of 1941, however, the Walker sisters
relented a little and sold their 50 hectares (123 acres)
to the United States for $4,750 and a lifetime lease.
Partly because of this unique situation, this special
lifestyle, park officials delayed any well-defined program
to recreate and present a vanishing culture.
When the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> “discovered” the
Walker sisters in 1946, tourists in the Smokies flocked
to the Walker home as if it were a museum of
Appalachia. The sisters themselves tolerated the
visitors, even sold mountain “souvenirs.” But the
years passed, three of the sisters died, and in 1953
Margaret Jane and Louisa wrote to the park
superintendent:</p>

<p>“<i>I have a request to you Will you please have the
Sign a bout the Walker Sisters taken down the one
on High Way 73 especially the reason I am asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
this there is just 2 of the sister lives at the old House
place one is 70 years of age the other is 82 years of
age and we can’t receive so many visitors. We are
not able to do our Work and receive so many visitors,
and can’t make sovioners to sell like we once did and
people will be expecting us to have them....</i>”</p>

<p>The park, of course, cooperated and helped the
sisters until Louisa, the last, died in 1964.</p>

<p>Increasingly the park recognized the value of the
human history of the Smokies. Out of that recognition
came interpretive projects and exhibits at Cades
Cove, Oconaluftee, Sugarlands, and a variety of
other sites which showed and still show the resiliency
and the creativity of the Appalachian mountaineer.</p>

<p>The same mix of problem, potential, and progress
has made itself felt on the Eastern Band of the
Cherokees. Their population within the Qualla
Boundary doubled from approximately 2,000 in 1930
to more than 4,000 forty years later. This increase
has only pointed more urgently to the economic,
social, and cultural challenges confronting the
Cherokees.</p>

<p>By 1930, the inhabitants of the Qualla Boundary
had reached a kind of balance between the customs
of the past and the demands of the present. Most
families owned 12 or 16 hectares (30 or 40 acres) of
woodland, with a sixth of that cleared and planted in
corn, beans, or potatoes. A log or frame house, a
small barn and other outbuildings, and the animals—a
horse, a cow, a few hogs, chickens—rounded out
the Cherokee family’s possessions, which about
equalled those of the neighboring whites. The Eastern
Band itself was unified by two main strands: first,
the land tenure system by which the more than
20,230 Qualla hectares (50,000 acres) could be leased,
but not sold, to whites; and second, the lingering
social organization of the clan.</p>

<p>These clans, which largely paralleled the five main
towns of Birdtown, Wolftown, Painttown, Yellow
Hill, and Big Cove, stabilized the population into
groups and offered, through such methods as the
dance, an outlet for communication and expression.
Through the Friendship dance, for example, young
people could meet each other. The Bugah dance
depended upon joking and teasing among relatives.
And the revered Eagle dance celebrated victory in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
the ball games between Cherokee communities.</p>

<p>The whirlwind changes of the mid-20th century
tipped whatever balance the Cherokees had gained.
The Great Depression, World War II, and the explosion
of tourism and mobility and business opportunity
brought inside the Qualla Boundary both a
schedule of modernization and a table of uncertainty.
The dance declined in importance. Surrounding
counties seemed to take better advantage of the new
trends than these natives who had been cast into a
political no-man’s-land.</p>

<p>By the 1950s, the Eastern Band could look forward
to a series of familiar paradoxes: relatively
poor education; a wealth of small tourist enterprise
and a dearth of large, stable industry; an unsurpassed
mountain environment and an appalling state of public
health. A 1955 survey of health conditions, for
instance, found that 90 percent of 600 homes in
seven Cherokee districts had insufficient water,
sewage, and garbage facilities. More than 95 percent
of the housing was substandard. Diseases springing
from inadequate sanitation prevailed.</p>

<p>The situation changed and is still in the process of
change. The Eastern Band could not and cannot
allow such oversight, such undercommittment. The
Qualla Boundary Community Action Program sponsored
day-care centers in several Cherokee communities.
In the years surrounding 1960, three industries
manufacturing products from quilts to moccasins
located at Cherokee and began to employ hundreds
of men and women on a continuing, secure basis. A
few years later, community action turned its efforts
to the housing problem; as the program drove ahead,
400 homes were either “constructed or significantly
improved,” reducing the percentage of substandard
houses to about 50 percent. As for living facilities,
the percentages have been exactly reversed: 90 percent
of homes now have septic tanks and safe water.</p>

<p>The Cherokee Boys’ Club, a nonprofit organization
incorporated in 1964, has improved the quality
of life within the Qualla Boundary. The club’s self-supporting
projects include a complete bus service
for Cherokee schools and garbage collection for the
North Carolina side of the Smokies. Along with the
Qualla Civic Center, the Boys’ Club serves a useful
socializing function as the modern equivalent to past
dances and rituals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the soundest of the native Cherokee businesses
is the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual. Since
1947, the Qualla Co-op has marketed the work of
hundreds of Indian craftsmen. Magnificent carvings
of cherry and walnut and baskets of river cane and
honeysuckle preserve the skills and art of the past
and symbolize the performance and the promise of
the Eastern Band of the Cherokees.</p>

<p>The Tennessee portion of the Great Smoky Mountains
has seen its share of major accomplishments
through imagination and hard work. One such accomplishment
is Gatlinburg’s Arrowmont School of
Arts and Crafts, known as the Pi Beta Phi Settlement
School during the early years of the century.</p>

<p>In 1910, Gatlinburg comprised a half-dozen
houses, a couple of general stores, a church, and
scant educational facilities. Perhaps 200 families
lived in the upper watershed of the Little Pigeon
River, and these families looked to Gatlinburg for
trading, visiting, and whatever learning they could
reasonably expect to receive during their lifetimes.
In that year, the national sorority of Pi Beta Phi
decided to establish a needed educational project
somewhere in rural America; after discussing a possible
site with the U.S. commissioner of education,
who suggested Tennessee, and the state commissioner,
who chose Sevier County, and the county
superintendent, who pointed to the isolated community
of Gatlinburg, the group picked this little village
in the shadow of the Great Smokies as the area in
which they would work.</p>

<p>On February 20, 1912, Martha Hill, a neatly
dressed and determined young brunette from
Nashville, opened school in an abandoned Baptist
church at the junction of Baskins Creek and the
Little Pigeon River. Thirteen suspicious but willing
pupils, their ages ranging from 4 to 24, offered themselves
for instruction. At first, attendance was
irregular, but by Christmastime, a celebration at the
schoolroom drew a crowd of 300. Miss Hill, herself
tired and a bit ill from spending exhausting hours
nursing several sick neighbors, had to be brought to
the party by wagon from a cottage she had leased for
$1.50 per month.</p>

<p>The winter warmed into spring and the one-room
school grew into a settlement school. Workers from
Pi Beta Phi organized a sewing club for girls, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
baseball club for boys. Martha Hill gathered some
books together to form the nucleus of a library.
Students built barns and chicken houses on land
bought with sorority and community contributions.</p>

<p>During the next two years, achievements small
and large piled upon each other. The library expanded
to almost 2,000 books; school enrollment
swelled to well over 100. Pi Phi sank a second well,
tended a fruit orchard, took the children on their
first trip to Maryville. The people of Gatlinburg
began to accept the school both in spirit and in fact.</p>

<p>Activities branched out into other fields. In the
fall of 1920, nurse Phyllis Higinbotham, an experienced
graduate of Johns Hopkins, converted the old
cottage into a hospital. Endowed with both unswerving
dedication and unending friendliness, “Miss
Phyllis” walked and rode from house to house,
trained midwives, taught hygiene, and persuaded
doctors from Knoxville and Sevierville to keep occasional
office hours in Gatlinburg. In 1926, after firmly
establishing a model rural health center, Phyllis
Higinbotham became state supervisor of public
health nurses for Tennessee.</p>

<p>As time passed, the county and the burgeoning
town assumed greater responsibility for the Pi Beta
Phi Settlement School’s crucial progress in the vital
areas of health and education. But the broad-based
school was by no means undermined. Almost as
soon as it had arrived in Gatlinburg, Pi Phi had
begun offering adult courses in home economics,
agriculture, weaving, and furniture making. These
courses formed the basis for a true cottage industry
which in the late 1920s benefitted more than 100
local families. And when the coming of the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park assured a constant
wave of tourism, the products of folk culture in the
Smokies rode the crest of that wave.</p>

<p>The present-day Arrowmont School of Arts and
Crafts, located upon a peaceful estate in the heart of
commercial Gatlinburg, attests to the imagination of
a generous group, the cooperation of a chosen
community, and the lasting good works of both. Like
Qualla, like the CCC camps, like the park today,
and, most of all, like the Walker place, Arrowmont
signifies the profound beauty that can result when
people practice a simple respect for their homeland.</p>

<p>Woods and meadows, fields
and mines and swamps, every
part of the natural scene
yielded some material that
could be transformed into a
handcrafted article of usefulness
and beauty. From the
trees came richly grained lumber
for furniture and musical
instruments, sturdy timber for
tools and utensils, and softer
wood for whittling “play-pretties”
and purely decorative
objects. Wood-working,
even sculpture, became one
of the outstanding skills of
mountain artisans. All the
crafts involved in textile design
and production were part
of the region’s history: weaving
and spinning, quilting and
braiding and hooking, making
dyes from roots, barks,
vegetables, herbs. Baskets
were woven from oak and
hickory splits, from river
cane, and honeysuckle vines.</p>

<p>Cherokee and mountaineer
alike shared designs and
shapes for the baskets made
from different materials for
uses ranging from egg-gathering
to household storage.</p>

was something done
by both men and women.
Clay, fashioned on rude,
homemade potter’s wheels of
the earlier days, provided pots
and pitchers of primitive
handsomeness and daily utility.
Broomcorn and sedge offered
materials for rough but
effective brooms. Leather
crafts arose from the need for
harnesses on mules and horse,
and shoes on people. Skinning,
treating, tanning were
just the first steps of a long,
demanding process of turning
raw hide into usable
leather. The use of corn
shucks illustrated with special
clarity the mountain person’s
inventiveness in utilizing
everything he raised or acquired.
Corn shucks could
make a stout chair-bottom or
a captivating little mountain
doll. Nimble fingers turned
the husks into a dozen different
articles. In his <i>Handicrafts
of the Southern Highlands</i>,
Allen H. Eaton wrote in 1937:
“We must try to find the
qualities of excellence which
these people have developed
before insisting that they accept
our formula for living,
thinking, and expression....
Better certainly, if we know,
as those who have worked and
lived in the Highlands have
had a chance to know, what
are the standards and the
ideals to which the people
cling. But even that experience
should not be necessary
for us to understand and to
cherish the spirit of the young
highlander who, after expressing
gratitude to the missionary
who had come in to help
build a school, said with characteristic
mountain frankness,
‘Bring us your civilization, but
leave us our own culture.’”</p>

<p>Tremont. This Tennessee valley of the Middle Prong
of the Little River does not differ widely from Deep
Creek or Greenbrier or Cosby or most of the other
branches and hollows of the Smokies. Each, including
Tremont, penetrates the hills, divides them like a
furrow, and protects its own rocky, racing stream
with a matting of thick, green growth. Nearby Cades
Cove and North Carolina’s Cataloochee might guard
a few hectares of lush, hill-cradled pasture or
farmland, but even these are stamped with the clear,
cool air and feel of the Great Smoky Mountains.</p>

<p>So Tremont is representative. And, perhaps because
of this, it is a symbol—a symbol of both the
mystery and the clarity of the mountains which give
it a name. There is, for example, the legend of a
small boy who wandered into the backcountry above
the “Sinks” and was lost for two days. Uncle Henry
Stinnett, a worried neighbor, searched in vain for the
boy until he dreamed, on the second night, of a child
sleeping near a log on a familiar ridge. Henry Stinnett
renewed the search, and the boy was indeed found
asleep “under the uprooted stump of a tree.”</p>

<p>And side by side with such a strange vision exists
its opposite: the unforeseen. In August of 1947, a
young woman was sunbathing on the boulders of the
river. While she enjoyed the rays of the warm sun
downstream, the high upper reaches of the prong
were being flooded by the swollen, flash attacks of a
hidden cloudburst. Within minutes, the woman
drowned in a hurtling wall of water.</p>

<p>Yet there is also a clarity here that offsets the
unknown. It is a quality of outlook, a confidence of
ability and expectation for the future as immense as
the mountains which inspire it. But it is an awareness
grounded in the facts of history and anecdote and
the crisp, fresh sounds of children’s voices.</p>

<p>“Black Bill” Walker knew about children; he had
more than 25 himself. A double first cousin to the
father of Little Greenbrier’s Walker sisters, “Black
Bill” or “Big Will” Walker moved into the lonely
valley in 1859. He was only 21 years old then, and his
name was simply William. He was accompanied by
his strong 19-year-old wife, Nancy.</p>

<p>His mother was a Scot, a member of the McGill
clan. His father, Marion, was another of those multitalented
frontiersmen: miller, cattleman, orchardist,
bear hunter, saddlebag preacher. William took up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
where his parents left off. He became the leader, the
ruler of the community he had started. He was
rumored to have been a Mormon, although denominations
mattered little in the wilderness. He and
Nancy raised seven children. Later wives bore him
approximately 20 more.</p>

<p>He milled his own corn and built log cabins for
each of his families. He fashioned an immense
muzzle-loading rifle, nicknamed it “Old Death,” and
handled it with rare skill. Horace Kephart, in a 1918
magazine article, tells of a conversation he had with
the 80-year-old hunter:</p>

<p>“<i>Black Bill’s rifle was one he made with his own
hands in the log house where I visited him. He rifled
it on a wooden machine that was likewise of his own
make, and stocked it with wood cut on his own land.
The piece was of a little more than half-ounce bore,
and weighed 12&#189; pounds ... the old hunter showed
me how he loaded....</i></p>

<p>“‘<i>My bullets are run small enough so that a naked
one will jest slip down on the powder by its own
weight. When I’m in a hurry, I pour in the powder by
guess, wet a bullet in my mouth, and drop it down
the gun. Enough powder sticks to it to keep the ball
from falling out if I shoot downhill. Then I snatch a
cap from one o’ these strings, and—so.</i>’</p>

<p>“<i>The old man went through the motions like a
sleight-of-hand performer. The whole operation of
loading took barely ten seconds.</i>”</p>

<p>After Black Bill’s own children had grown, he
went to the nearby town of Maryville and requested
and received a school in the valley for children yet to
come. He governed his settlement, yet he was not
merely a governor. He was a remarkable man, an
individualist who also built a community.</p>

<p>After Black Bill’s death in 1919, life in Tremont
continued as before. Families still ate turkey and
pheasant, squirrel and venison, sweet potatoes and
the first greenery of spring, onions. Children’s bare
feet remained tough enough to break open chestnut
burrs. Mothers continued to put dried peaches in a
jar full of moonshine, let it sit a day or two, and test
their peach brandy with a sip or two. And on
Christmas, fathers and sons “got out and shot their
guns” in celebration.</p>

<p><i>Legend has it that Black Bill
Walker once went into a cave
after a bear and came out
alive—with the hide. The
story is probably true, for he
did many things on a grand
scale. He was the patriarch
not only of a large family, but
of a community.</i></p>

<p>Intervals of violence interrupted the daily routine.
Farmers with cattle and sheep freely roaming the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
ridges sometimes made it hard for others to grow
corn and similar crops. A hunter’s bear and ’coon
dogs might kill some sheep. One “war” ended with a
fire on Fodder Stack Mountain that raced down into
Chestnut Flats and killed a number of sheep. No
humans died, but the sheep men killed all the hunting
dogs in the vicinity.</p>

</div>

<p>By the early 1920s, change was creeping into the
valley. The Little River Lumber Company persuaded
Black Bill’s children to do what he would not do: sell
the timber. From the mid-twenties to the mid-thirties,
more than 1,000 workers lived in the logging town of
Tremont, patronized the Tremont Hotel, and hauled
away tens of thousands of the virgin forest’s giants.</p>

<p>With the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
came the CCC. The Civilian Conservation Corps
camp on the old lumber site, together with a Girl
Scout camp that would last until 1959, signaled a
retreat—and a progression—from the extractive industry
of the past. Although the CCC disbanded
during World War II, a modern-day CCC arrived in
1964. The Job Corps combined conservation work,
such as trail maintenance and stream cleaning, with
training in vital skills of roadbuilding, masonry, and
the operation of heavy machinery.</p>

<p>Then, in 1969, Tremont entered a new era. The
previous years of innovation seemed to prepare the
secluded valley for a truly fresh and creative effort in
education. The Walkers would have been proud of
what came to be the Environmental Education Center.</p>

<p>The Center draws on both original and time-tested
techniques to teach grade school children basic
awareness and respect for the natural world around
them. Because its achievements are both fundamental
and effective, and because it treats a splendid
mountain area as a lasting and deserving homeland
for plants and animals and human beings, the story
of Tremont culminates this history of the Great
Smoky Mountains. For here is one of the ways the
Smokies can be best used: as a wild refuge and a
living laboratory where young people may discover
the deeper meaning of the park’s past and why, for
the future, there is a park at all.</p>

<p>The Environmental Education Center, administered
by Maryville College from 1969 through 1979
and since then by Great Smoky Mountains Natural
History Association, evolved through planning by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
both the park and nearby county school systems. One
of the rangers, Lloyd Foster, became so attached to
the ideas being presented that he obtained a leave of
absence from his work, persistently promoted the
project, and became Tremont’s first director. Experienced
teachers such as Elsie Burrell and Randolph
Shields helped Foster convert talk into action, rhetoric
into experience.</p>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The center soon offered a real alternative to conventional
and overcrowded schools caught in the
midst of industrialization. Teacher-led or parent-supervised
classes from a multitude of states and
cities organized themselves, paid a base fee for each
member, and came to the valley for one week during
the year. Within months, Tremont was teaching elementary
students at the rate of thousands per year.
The organizers retained their informal, camp-like
approach to interested groups and added to the original
dining room and two dormitories an audiovisual
room and a laboratory complete with powerful
microscopes. As the program expanded, children
could fulfill their imaginative promptings in an art
room, or build a miniature skidder in the crafts
room, or turn to a library of extensive readings.</p>

<p>As the idea of environmental education at
Tremont and elsewhere spread by word of mouth,
volunteers from across the country arrived and aided
those already at work. High school and college students
participated in and still attend weekend conferences
on the activities and the progress of the Center.</p>

<p>They learn, first of all, fundamental concepts that
are expressed simply: “You don’t have to have a lot
of fancy buildings to do a good program,” or “You
know, sometimes we teach a lot of theory and we
don’t really get down to—I guess you’d call it the
nitty-gritty,” or even “Now don’t chicken out, the
way some of you did last time, step in the water.”</p>

<p>They learn of “quiet hour,” when, at the beginning
of the week, each child stakes out a spot for himself
in the woods, beside the stream, wherever choice
leads. For an hour each day, in sun or rain, everybody
seeks his or her own place and is assured of
peace and privacy. A girl writes a poem to her
parents; a fourth-grader contemplates on a rock by
the water; and almost everyone who observes the
quiet hour looks forward to it eagerly each day.</p>

<p>They learn about the highly effective lessons that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
are scattered throughout the week, lessons such as
“man and water,” “stream ecology,” “continuity and
change.” Imaginative gatherings become not the exception
but the rule: “Sometimes we take a group of
children, divide them into members of a make-believe
pioneer family, and take them up into a
wilderness area, an area which is truly pristine, almost
a virgin forest. And we let the kids imagine that
they are this pioneer family, and that they are going
to pick out a house site.” In one game called
“succession,” a boy from blacktopped, “civilized”
Atlanta might search along a road for signs of life on
the pavement, then in the gravel, then in the grass,
then within the vast, teeming forest. And a day’s trip
to the Little Greenbrier schoolhouse gives the children
of today a chance to experience what it was like
when the Walker sisters and their ancestors sat on
the hard wooden benches and learned the three R’s
and felt the bite of a hickory switch.</p>

<p>It may seem odd that modern children should
enjoy so much a trip to school. But enjoy it they do,
for as they fidget on the wooden benches or spell
against each other in an old-fashioned “spelldown”
or read a mid-1800s dictionary that defines a kiss as
“a salute with the lips,” they enter into a past place
and a past time. For a few minutes, at least, they
identify with the people who used to be here in these
Smokies—not “play-acting” but struggling to survive
and improve their lives.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse itself is old, built in 1882 out of
poplar logs and white oak shingles. Its single room
used to double as a church for the community, but
now the two long, narrow windows on either side
open out onto the protected forest of the park. A
woman stands in the doorway, dressed in a pink
bonnet and an old-fashioned, ankle-length dress. She
rings a cast iron bell. The children, who have been
out walking on this early spring morning, hear the
bell and begin to run toward it. Some of them see the
school and shout and beckon the others. In their
hurry, they spread out and fill the clearing with
flashes of color and expectation. The woman in the
doorway is their teacher.</p>

<p>They have spanned a century and longer. They
now live in more worlds than one, because they have
come to the place where their spirit lives. It is again
homecoming in the Great Smoky Mountains.</p>

</div>


<p>“You can’t get there from here,” an
oldtimer might tell you about traveling
in the Smokies, and you might think
that’s true when you get on some of
the back roads in the area. But if you
stick mostly to the paved roads and
use your auto map and the map in this
book, you should not have much or any
trouble finding your way around Great
Smoky Mountains National Park.</p>

<p>The park, which is administered by
the National Park Service, U.S. Department
of the Interior, is located along
the border between North Carolina
and Tennessee. It can be reached by
major highways in both states and by
the Blue Ridge Parkway, which connects
the park with Shenandoah National
Park in Virginia. Newfound Gap
Road, the only road that crosses the
park, connects Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
with Cherokee, North Carolina. It is
closed to commercial vehicles.</p>

<p>There are just a few other roads
within the park itself, so travel between
distant points is quite roundabout
and time consuming. But you will
see plenty of nice scenery along the
way. Because this handbook focuses
on the history of the area, the travel
information does, too. But by no means
should you let the limited scope presented
here limit what you do. We
encourage you to enjoy the scenic
views, flowers, shrubs, and wildlife as
you travel to and through the historic
sites. For example, while you’re in the
Cable Mill area at Cades Cove, you
might take the trail to Abrams Falls.
It’s a delightful short hike to a beautiful
spot in the park. And if you take
the Roaring Fork Auto Tour, you
might hike the 2.4 kilometers (1.5
miles) through a hemlock forest to
Grotto Falls. There are plenty of other
short hikes in the park, and when you
take them you may come across
decaying ruins of early settlements.</p>


<p>Visitor Centers</p>

<p>Park headquarters and the major
visitor center are at Sugarlands, 3.2
kilometers (2 miles) south of Gatlinburg.
Other visitor centers are at
Cades Cove and at Oconaluftee, both
of which are prime historical areas in
the park. The Sugarlands and
Oconaluftee centers are open 8 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. during the winter, with extended
hours the rest of the year. The
Cades Cove center, located in the Cable
Mill area on the loop road, is open
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from mid-April
through October. Exhibits at the Cades
Cove and Oconaluftee centers feature
the human history of the Smokies. The
relative flatness of the Cades Cove
area makes this the best place to bicycle
in the park.</p>


<p>Walks and Talks</p>

<p>Some of the guided walks and evening
programs deal with history. Check
schedules at the visitor centers and
campgrounds or in the park newspaper.</p>

<p>Mountain lifeways and skills are
demonstrated periodically from early
spring through October at the Pioneer
Farmstead at Oconaluftee, Cades
Cove, Mingus Mill, and Little Greenbrier
School. At Oconaluftee you can
walk through a typical Smokies farm
and see many of yesteryear’s household
chores being demonstrated. At
Cades Cove, you can see, among other
things, how sorghum and wooden shingles
were made. Millers seasonally operate
the gristmills near Oconaluftee
and at Cades Cove. All of these demonstrations
indicate that the good old
days were not easy ones.</p>

sites, stay on the trails, keep children
under control, enjoy the farm animals at
a distance, and stay safely away from
the millwheels and other machinery.</p>

<p>While traveling throughout the park,
beware of the many black bears no
matter how tame they may appear. If
they approach your vehicle, keep the
windows closed. Do not feed the bears!</p>

<p>And keep in mind that the weather
can change quickly in the Smokies and
that hypothermia can strike not only in
the winter but at any season. Be careful
not to become wet and/or chilled.
Carry extra clothing.</p>

<p>See Handbook 112, <i>Great Smoky
Mountains</i>, for more precautions and

<p><i>At the Pioneer Farmstead in
Oconaluftee you can get a
glimpse of what daily farm life
was like in the Smokies. Besides
the ongoing kitchen tasks,
chores included tending cows
and chickens, cutting and
stacking hay, building and
repairing barns and wagons,
and a thousand other things.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Self-sufficiency and individuality were
strong traits in the Smokies. Each person
had to do a variety of tasks, and
each family member had to help or
complement the others. Just as Milas
Messer (see pages <a href="#Page_90">90-91</a>) exemplified
these traits personally, the Pioneer
Farmstead at Oconaluftee on the North
Carolina side of the park represents
them structurally. Various buildings
have been brought here to create a
typical Smokies farmstead on the
banks of the Oconaluftee River.</p>

<p>In the summer and fall farm animals
roam about the farmstead and a man
and a woman carry out daily chores to
give you an idea of what the pioneers
had to do just to exist. At first these
Jacks- and Jills-of-all-trades had no
stores to go to. They made their own
tools, built their own houses and barns
and outbuildings, raised their own
food, made their own clothes, and
doctored themselves, for the most part.</p>

<p>The log house here is a particularly
nice one, for John Davis built it with
matched walls. He split the logs in half
and used the halves on opposite walls.
The two stone chimneys are typical of
the earliest houses. Davis’ sons, then 8
and 4, collected rocks for the chimneys
with oxen and a sled.</p>

<p>Behind the house is an essential
building, the meathouse. Here meat,
mostly pork, was layered on the shelf
at the far end and covered with a thick
coating of salt. After the meat had
cured, it was hung from poles, which
go from end to end, to protect it from
rodents. In the early years especially,
bear meat and venison hung alongside
the pork.</p>



<p>Apples were a big part of the settlers’
diet in a variety of forms: cider,
vinegar, brandy, sauces, and pies. And
of course they ate them, too, right off
the tree. The thick rock walls on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
lower floor of the apple house protect
the fruit from freezing in winter. The
summer apples were kept on the log-wall
second floor.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp23" id="i151" style="max-width: 36em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i151.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The Indians’ maize, or corn, was the
most essential crop on the typical
Smokies farmstead. Besides being used
as food for livestock, it was the staple
for the pioneers themselves. With corn
they made corn bread, hoe cakes, corn
meal mush, and even a little moonshine.
The harvested crop was kept
dry in a corncrib until used.</p>

<p>As the pioneers became more settled
and turned into farmers, they built
barns to provide shelter for their cows,
oxen, sheep, and horses, plus some of
their farming equipment and hay. The
large, log barn at the Oconaluftee
Farmstead is unusual. It is a drovers’
barn—a hotel for cattle and other animals
driven to market. The barn is
located close to its original site.</p>

<p>Most farmers had a small blacksmith
shop where they could bang out
a few tools, horseshoes, hinges, and,
later on, parts for farm machinery.
These structures were not very
sophisticated; they just had to provide
a little shelter so the fire could be kept
going and to protect the equipment—and
to keep the smith dry—during
inclement weather.</p>

<p>The springhouse served not only as
the source of water but as a refrigerator.
Here milk, melons, and other
foods were kept, many of them in large
crocks. The water usually ran through
the springhouse in one half of a
hollowed out log, or in a rock-lined
trench. On hot, muggy days, a child
sent to the springhouse for food or
water might tarry a moment or two to
enjoy the air conditioning.</p>

<p>The farmstead is open all year, but
the house is open only from May to
November.</p>

<p><i>The Methodist Church, Cable
Mill, and Gregg-Cable house
are just three of the many log or
frame structures still standing in
Cades Cove today.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just as Oconaluftee represents self-sufficiency
and individuality, Cades
Cove illustrates those traits, plus something
else: a sense of community. Here
individuals and families worked hard
at eking out a living from day to day,
but here, too, everyone gathered together
from time to time to help harvest
a crop, raise a barn, build a
church, and maintain a school. The
structural evidence of this helping-hand
attitude still stands today in
Cataloochee (see pages <a href="#Page_154">154-155</a>) and
in Cades Cove.</p>

<p>At its peak in 1850, Cades Cove had
685 residents in 132 households. A few
years after that the population shrank
to 275 as the soil became overworked
and as new lands opened up in the
West. Then the population rose again
to about 500 just before the park was
established.</p>

<p>The State of Tennessee had acquired
this land in 1820 from the Cherokees
and then sold it to speculators,
who in turn sold plots to the settlers.
They cleared most of the trees and
built their houses at the foot of the
surrounding hills. Corn, wheat, oats,
and rye were raised on the flat lands,
whereas the slopes were used for
pastures, orchards, and vegetable
gardens. The Park Service leases some
of the land here today to farmers to
keep the cove open as it was in the
early settlement days.</p>


<p>In Cades Cove you will find some of
the finest log buildings in America.
Some are original; the others come
from elsewhere in the park. The first
log house on the 18-kilometer
(11-mile)-loop-road tour belonged to
John and Lurena Oliver, who bought
their land in 1826. Their cabin, with its
stone chimney and small windows, is
typical of many in the Smokies, and it
remained in the Oliver family until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
park was established. A stone in the
Primitive Baptist Church cemetery just
down the road commemorates John
and Lurena, the first permanent white
settlers in the cove. The church was
organized in 1827, and the log building
was used until 1887, though the
members, who were pro-Union, felt
they had to shut it down during the
Civil War because of strong rebel
sentiment.</p>

<p>The Methodist Church supposedly
was built by one man, J. D. McCampbell,
in 115 days for $115, and after he
was done he served as its preacher for
many years. The frame Missionary
Baptist Church was built in 1894 by a
group that split from the Primitive
Baptists in 1839 because it endorsed
missionary work.</p>

<p>Elijah Oliver’s log house may well be
one of the first split-levels. The lower
kitchen section off the back formerly
was the home of the Herron family and
was brought here and attached to the
main house. This is a good place to see
some of the many auxiliary structures
most families had: springhouse, barn,
and smokehouse.</p>

<p>Many families also had a tub mill
with which they could grind a bushel
of corn a day. When they had more
corn to grind, they would take it to a
larger mill, such as John Cable’s. His
was not the first waterwheel mill in
Cades Cove, but it is the only remaining
one today. It has been rehabilitated
a few times, but the main
framing, the millstones, and some of
the gears are original.</p>

<p>In the Cable Mill area are several
other structures that have been brought
here from other parts of the park.
Among them is the Gregg-Cable house,
possibly the first frame house in Cades
Cove. It was built by Leason Gregg in
1879 and later became the home, until
her death in 1940, of Becky Cable,
John’s daughter. At different times the
house served as a store and a boardinghouse.
The blacksmith shop, barns,
smokehouse, corncrib, and sorghum
mill are representative of such structures
in the Smokies.</p>

<p>Heading east from the mill area, you
come to the Henry Whitehead and
Dan Lawson places. At both you can
see some of the best log work, inside
and out, within the park, and both
have brick instead of stone chimneys.
These houses represent the transition
between the crude log house and the
finer log house. Further down the road
is “Hamp” Tipton’s place, where you
can see an apiary or bee gum stand.
Honey, sorghum, and maple syrup
were common sweets for folks in the
Cove.</p>

<p>The last house on the loop road is
the Carter Shields place, a one-story
log house with loft. This cabin is about
the average size of Smokies cabins, but
it is a bit fancier than most with its
beaded paneling in the living room and
a closed-in stairway.</p>

<p>The buildings in Cades Cove are
open all year except for the churches
and a few other structures.</p>

<p>Cades Cove and Oconaluftee are the
primary locations of historic structures
in the national park, but elsewhere
there are a few interesting buildings to
see.</p>

<p>From Gatlinburg head south on Airport
Road, which runs into Cherokee
Orchard Road in the park. Soon you
come to Noah “Bud” Ogle’s place.
Ogle and his wife, Cindy, started farming
here on 160 hectares (400 acres) in
1879. Here you can see a log house, log
barn, and restored tub mill.</p>

<p>South of the Ogle place you come to
Roaring Fork Auto Tour. On this one-way
8-kilometer (5-mile) tour you can
see that nature has reclaimed most of
the Roaring Fork community. Among
the few remaining buildings are Jim
Bales’ corncrib and barn, plus a log
house that was moved here.</p>

<p>Home for Ephraim Bales, his wife,
and nine children consisted of two
joined log cabins. The smaller one was
the kitchen, and in front of its hearth is
a “tater hole.” Family members could
lift up a floor board, remove some
potatoes from storage, and toss them
on the fire to bake. Other structures
here include a corncrib and barn.</p>

<p>A log house and mill are the only
structures that remain of the many
that belonged to Alfred Reagan, one
of Roaring Fork’s more talented
residents. He was a farmer, blacksmith,
preacher, miller, storekeeper, and
carpenter. His house was more refined
than most in the Smokies.</p>

<p>The Roaring Fork Auto Tour road is
open from mid-April to mid-November.</p>

<p>In the Oconaluftee Valley just north
of the Pioneer Farmstead is Mingus
Mill, built for Abraham Mingus in the
1870s by Sion Thomas Early. This
gristmill, the finest and most advanced
in the Smokies, has a water-powered
turbine beneath it. Water flows down a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
millrace and flume to the mill, and,
when the flume gate is raised, fills the
penstock to power the turbine. The
mill has two sets of grinding stones,
one for corn and one for wheat. The
mill was in operation until 1936,
reopened for a few months in 1940,
and reconditioned by the Great Smoky
Mountains Natural History Association
in 1968. It is open daily from May
through October with a miller usually
on duty to explain its workings.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp24" id="i155" style="max-width: 36.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i155.jpg" alt="">
</figure>


<p>North of Mingus Mill is Smokemont.
All that remains of this small community
is the Oconaluftee Baptist Church,
a frame structure that sits high on a
bluff.</p>

<p>Just off Little River Road between
Sugarlands and Tremont is Little
Greenbrier School (see pages <a href="#Page_85">85</a> and
<a href="#Page_144">144</a>). In the summer an interpreter
often is on hand to help children, and
adults, understand what going to
school was like in the Smokies. The
road to the school is narrow and
unpaved and not the easiest to negotiate
in inclement weather, so you may
want to walk in.</p>

<p>Several buildings are still standing in
the isolated Cataloochee area on the
North Carolina side of the park. They
include Palmer Chapel, Beech Grove
School, and the Jarvis Palmer, Hiram
Caldwell, and Steve Woody homes.
Most of the buildings are open, and a
ranger is on duty to answer your
questions. The fields are mowed to
maintain the cove effect from early
settlement days. Reaching Cataloochee
from the north means a lengthy trip on
unpaved road; from the south it’s a bit
easier. If you have the time, visiting
Cataloochee is worth the extra effort.</p>

<p><i>At Mabry Mill on the Blue Ridge Parkway you can see old-time skills
 demonstrated in the summer and fall. Weaving is just one of many
 traditional crafts taught at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts
 in Gatlinburg.</i></p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A number of nearby sites are related
in one way or the other to the history
of the Great Smoky Mountains. Here
are a few that you might visit while
vacationing in the Smokies:</p>

<p>The arts, crafts, and lifeways of the
Cherokees are portrayed by the tribe
at the Qualla Reservation, adjacent to
the North Carolina side of the park.
The Museum of the Cherokee Indian
displays a collection of artifacts, and
the Oconaluftee Living Indian Village
shows typical early Cherokee life in
log structures. The play “Unto These
Hills” tells the story of the Cherokees
and their encounters with Europeans
settling in the Smokies and of the
forced removal of most of the tribe to
Oklahoma in 1838. About 4,000 Cherokees
live on the Qualla Reservation
today.</p>

<p>The Arrowmont School of Arts and
Crafts in Gatlinburg has done much to
perpetuate the pottery, weaving, and
other skills indicative of the Smokies
people. The school displays and sells
objects created by local artisans.</p>

<p>The Museum of Appalachia in
Norris, Tennessee, just north of
Knoxville, has 30 restored pioneer log
structures, a representative farmstead,
and more than 200,000 artifacts of
mountain life.</p>

<p>The Blue Ridge Parkway, administered
by the National Park Service, has
several log houses, a gristmill, a reconstructed
farm, and other early American
buildings. Much of the 755-kilometer
(469-mile), parkway, which adjoins
Great Smoky Mountains National
Park near Oconaluftee and runs north
into Virginia, is quite far from the
park, but some of the historic points of
interest are in the southern portion.
The Folk Art Center, at milepost 382,
displays traditional crafts of the Southern
Highlands.</p>

<p>The cover photograph was taken by Ed Cooper. The
rest of the color photography, unless otherwise
credited, was taken by William A. Bake of Boone,
North Carolina. Nearly all of the black-and-white
photographs come from the files of Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. About half of them were
taken in the 1930s for historic recording purposes by
Edouard E. Exline and Charles S. Grossman on
behalf of the National Park Service. Exline was a
landscape architect with the Civilian Conservation
Corps and a photographer by avocation. Grossman
was a structural architect for the park who was in
charge of the cultural preservation program.
The other photographers who have been identified
are Laura Thornborough, who resided in the Smokies
and wrote the book <i>The Great Smoky Mountains</i>;
Joseph S. Hall, who has studied and written about
linguistics of the Smokies since the 1930s; Harry M.
Jennison, a research botanist from the University of
Tennessee who worked in the park from 1935 to
1940; H.C. Wilburn, a CCC history technician who
collected and purchased artifacts of mountain life;
Maurice Sullivan, a CCC wildlife technician who
subsequently became a Park Service naturalist;
Alden Stevens, a museum specialist for the Park
Service; Jim Shelton, husband of one of the Walker
sisters, Sarah Caroline; George Masa, who established
the Asheville Photo Service shortly after
World War I; Burton Wolcott; and National Park
Service photographers George A. Grant, Alan Rinehart,
Fred R. Bell, M. Woodbridge Williams, and
Clair Burket.</p>

<p>Many of the logging photographs were donated to
the park by the Little River Lumber Company. Most
of the photographs of Cherokees come from the
National Anthropological Archives at the Smithsonian
Institution; many of them were taken by
James Mooney in the Smokies area in 1888.</p>

<p>As the Nation’s principal conservation agency, the
Department of the Interior has responsibility for
most of our nationally owned public lands and natural
resources. This includes fostering the wisest use
of our land and water resources, protecting our fish
and wildlife, preserving the environmental and cultural
values of our national parks and historical
places, and providing for the enjoyment of life
through outdoor recreation. The Department assesses
our energy and mineral resources and works
to assure that their development is in the best interest
of all our people. The Department also has a
major responsibility for American Indian reservation
communities and for people who live in Island
Territories under U.S. administration.</p>
